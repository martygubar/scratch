It was the first theatrically-released, cinematic film to feature Auslan (Australian Sign Language) as both a main language of the film's dialogue, as well as a key plot element in the story.  The plot concerns Reuben (played by Davo Hardy), who overcomes a speech impediment with the use of Auslan, with help from his profoundly deaf boyfriend (played by Joshua Sealy). Having built up Reuben's confidence enough to encourage his higher ambitions, Derek contacts an Australian screen legend, Gareth (played by Paul Mercurio) to help mentor Reuben in his burgeoning career. But shortly after seeing the potential in Reuben's autobiographical screenplay, Gareth takes over the project for his own gain and sanitizes the story to suit a wider audience, thereby cutting Reuben out of the equation. Forced to draw upon the courage and self-actualization that he has gathered through the experience, Reuben stands up to his bully and wins the support of those who had once opposed him, for the greater moral good.  Davo Hardy has stated in interviews that the film was a response to his film mentors telling him he could not be a director because of his real-life stutter.\n143\tA Woman's Tale\t\t3.99\t49584\t[\"Unknown\"]\tJUZ39421\t1991\t1991-01-01 00:00:00\t5\t[\"Sheila Florance\",\"Gosia Dobrowolska\",\"Norman Kaye\",\"Chris Haywood\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Paul Cox\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Paul Cox\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Paul Cox\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t93\tA Woman's Tale is a 1991 Australian film directed by Paul Cox and starring Sheila Florance, Gosia Dobrowolska, Norman Kaye, Chris Haywood and Ernie Gray.\n150\tAbduction\t\t4.99\t\t[\"Drama\"]\tZKE87206\t1975\t1975-01-01 00:00:00\t13\t\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Joseph Zito\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t95\tAbduction is a 1975 American thriller film directed by Joseph Zito, produced and written by Kent E.

The screenplay by William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert dramatizes the aborted 1970 Apollo 13 lunar mission and is an adaptation of the 1994 book Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13 , by astronaut Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger. The film depicts astronauts Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise aboard Apollo 13 for America's fifth crewed mission to the Moon, which was intended to be the third to land. En route, an on-board explosion deprives their spacecraft of much of its oxygen supply and electrical power, which forces NASA's flight controllers to abort the Moon landing and turns the mission into one of seeking scientific and mechanical solutions to get the three men home safely.  Howard went to great lengths to create a technically accurate movie, employing NASA's assistance in astronaut and flight-controller training for his cast and obtaining permission to film scenes aboard a reduced gravity aircraft for realistic depiction of the weightlessness experienced by the astronauts in space.  Released to cinemas in the United States on June 30, 1995, Apollo 13 received critical acclaim and was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture (winning for Best Film Editing and Best Sound). The film also won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, as well as two British Academy Film Awards. In total, the film grossed over $355 million worldwide during its theatrical releases.\n325\tArchaeology of a Woman\t\t2.99\t\t[\"Mystery\"]\tIEP99931\t2012\t2012-01-01 00:00:00\t1\t[\"Sally Kirkland\"]\t[]\t\t\t\t\t\tArchaeology of a Woman is a 2012 American mystery film written and directed by Sharon Greytak and starring Sally Kirkland and Victoria Clark.\n333\tArmageddon Gospels\t\t0\t\t[\"Unknown\"]\tOZQ38004\t2020\t2020-01-01 00:00:00\t13\t\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"FoolishPeople\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t95\tArmageddon Gospels is a 2019 British folk horror film written, produced and, directed by John Harrigan and produced by the British immersive theatre and production collective FoolishPeople.

Set in 1941, it stars John Turturro in the title role as a young New York City playwright who is hired to write scripts for a film studio in Hollywood, and John Goodman as Charlie Meadows, the insurance salesman who lives next door at the run-down Hotel Earle.  The Coens wrote the screenplay for Barton Fink in three weeks while experiencing difficulty during the writing of Miller's Crossing. They began filming the former soon after Miller's Crossing was finished. The film is influenced by works of several earlier directors, particularly Roman Polanski's Repulsion (1965) and The Tenant (1976).  Barton Fink had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1991. In a rare sweep, it won the Palme d'Or as well as awards for Best Director and Best Actor (Turturro). Although the film was a box office bomb, only grossing $6 million against its $9 million budget, it received positive reviews and was nominated for three Academy Awards. Prominent themes of Barton Fink include the writing process; slavery and conditions of labor in creative industries; superficial distinctions between high culture and low culture; and the relationship of intellectuals with \"the common man\".  The diverse elements of the film have led it to defy efforts at genre classification, with the work being variously referred to as a film noir, a horror film, a Künstlerroman , and a buddy film. It contains various literary allusions and religious overtones, as well as references to many real-life people and events – most notably the writers Clifford Odets and William Faulkner, of whom the characters of Barton Fink and W. P. Mayhew, respectively, are often seen as fictional representations. Several features of the film's narrative, particularly an image of a woman at the beach which recurs throughout, have sparked much commentary, with the Coens acknowledging some intentional symbolic elements while denying an attempt to communicate any single message in the film.\n427\tBatman Dracula\t\t0\t\t[\"Thriller\"]\tEQD53260\t1964\t1964-01-01 00:00:00\t52\t[\"Naomi Levine\",\"Gerard Malanga\",\"Taylor Mead\",\"Jack Smith\",\"David Bourdon\",\"Beverly Grant\",\"Sam Green\",\"Jane Holzer\",\"Mario Montez\",\"Ondine\",\"Dorothy Dean\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Andy Warhol\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Andy Warhol\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t54\tBatman Dracula is a 1964 black and white American superhero fan film, produced and directed by Andy Warhol, without the permission of DC Comics, who owns the character Batman.\n434\tBattle Cry\t\t0\t8000000\t[\"Drama\",\"Romance\"]\tINF96219\t1955\t1955-01-01 00:00:00\t75\t[\"Van Heflin\",\"Aldo Ray\",\"Anne Francis\",\"Dorothy Malone\",\"Fess Parker\",\"James Whitmore\",\"John Lupton\",\"L.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 18th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Ryan Coogler, who co-wrote the screenplay with Joe Robert Cole, and it stars Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther alongside Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis. In Black Panther , T'Challa is crowned king of Wakanda following his father's death, but he is challenged by Killmonger who plans to abandon the country's isolationist policies and begin a global revolution.  Wesley Snipes planned to make a Black Panther film in 1992, but the project did not come to fruition. In September 2005, Marvel Studios listed a Black Panther film as one of ten films based on Marvel characters intended to be distributed by Paramount Pictures. Mark Bailey was hired to write a script in January 2011. Black Panther was officially announced in October 2014, and Boseman made his first appearance as the character in Captain America: Civil War (2016). Cole and Coogler had joined by then, with additional casting in May. Black Panther is the first Marvel Studios film with a Black director and a predominantly Black cast. Principal photography took place from January to April 2017 at EUE/Screen Gems Studios in the Atlanta metropolitan area, and in Busan, South Korea.  Black Panther premiered in Los Angeles on January 29, 2018, and was released theatrically in the United States on February 16, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. Critics praised its direction, screenplay, acting (particularly that of Boseman, Jordan, and Wright), costume design, production values, and soundtrack, but some criticized the computer-generated visual effects. Many critics considered the film to be one of the best in the MCU, and it was also noted for its cultural significance. Organizations such as the National Board of Review and American Film Institute named Black Panther as one of the top 10 films of 2018. It grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide and broke numerous box office records, becoming the highest-grossing film directed by a Black filmmaker, the ninth-highest-grossing film of all time, the third-highest- grossing film in the U.S. and Canada, and the second-highest-grossing film of 2018.  The film received numerous accolades, with seven nominations at the 91st Academy Awards including the first nomination for Best Picture for a superhero film, and the first Academy Award win for an MCU film with wins for Best Costume Design, Best Original Score, and Best Production Design. It also received three nominations at the 76th Golden Globe Awards, two wins at the 25th Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three wins at the 24th Critics' Choice Awards from twelve nominations, among others. A sequel, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever , is scheduled for release on July 8, 2022, while a television series set in Wakanda is in development for Disney+.\n522\tBlazing Saddles\t2600000\t0\t119600000\t[\"Comedy\",\"Western\"]\tHGL94272\t1974\t1974-01-01 00:00:00\t2949\t[\"Mel Brooks\",\"Gene Wilder\",\"Madeline Kahn\",\"Dom DeLuise\",\"Harvey Korman\",\"Cleavon Little\",\"Slim Pickens\",\"David Huddleston\",\"Liam Dunn\",\"Jack Starrett\",\"John Hillerman\",\"Alex Karras\",\"Count Basie\",\"George Furth\",\"Millie Slavin\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Michael Hertzberg\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Mel Brooks\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Andrew Bergman\",\"Mel Brooks\",\"Richard Pryor\"]}]\t[\"Warner Bros.\"]\t\t[\"National Film Registry\"]\t[\"Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress\",\"Academy Award for Best Film Editing\"]\t93\tBlazing Saddles is a 1974 American satirical Western black comedy film directed by Mel Brooks. Starring Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder, the film was written by Brooks, Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor, Norman Steinberg, and Alan Uger, and was based on Bergman's story and draft. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and audiences, was nominated for three Academy Awards and is ranked No. 6 on the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Laughs list.  Brooks appears in three supporting roles, Governor William J. Le Petomane, a Yiddish-speaking Native American chief and \"a director\" in line to help invade Rock Ridge (a nod to Hitchcock); he also dubs lines for one of Lili Von Shtupp's backing troupe. The supporting cast includes Slim Pickens, Alex Karras, and David Huddleston, as well as Brooks regulars Dom DeLuise, Madeline Kahn, and Harvey Korman. Bandleader Count Basie has a cameo as himself, appearing with his orchestra.  The film is full of deliberate anachronisms, from the Count Basie Orchestra playing \"April in Paris\" in the Wild West, to Slim Pickens referring to the Wide World of Sports.  In 2006, Blazing Saddles was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n530\tBlood Trails\t\t2.99\t\t[\"Horror\",\"Thriller\"]\tAYO95336\t2006\t2006-01-01 00:00:00\t4\t[\"Ben Price\"]\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Robert Krause\"]}]\t\tserial killer\t\t\t87\tBlood Trails is a 2006 German horror film written and directed by Robert Krause, and co-written by Florian Puchert.

The film stars John Travolta as Jack Terry, a movie sound effects technician from Philadelphia who, while recording sounds for a low-budget slasher film, serendipitously captures audio evidence of an assassination involving a presidential hopeful. Nancy Allen stars as Sally Bedina, a young woman involved in the crime. The supporting cast includes John Lithgow and Dennis Franz. The film's tagline in advertisements was, \"Murder has a sound all of its own\".  Directly based on Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 film Blowup , the film replaces the medium of photography with the medium of audio recording. The concept of Blow Out came to De Palma while he was working on the thriller Dressed to Kill (1980). The film was shot in the late autumn and winter of 1980 in various Philadelphia locations on a relatively substantial budget of $18 million.  Blow Out opened to minuscule audience interest at the time of release despite receiving a mostly positive critical reception. The lead performances by Travolta and Allen, the direction by DePalma and the visual style were cited as the strongest points of the film. Critics also recognised the stylistic and narrative connection to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, whom DePalma admires, and giallo films. Over the years since its initial theatrical release, it has developed status as a cult film and received a home media release by the Criterion Collection, a company which specializes in \"important classic and contemporary film\", which re-ignited public interest in the film.\n544\tBlue Jay\t\t0\t21626\t[\"Drama\",\"Romance\"]\tUIP10823\t2016\t2016-09-12 00:00:00\t252\t[\"Mark Duplass\",\"Sarah Paulson\",\"Clu Gulager\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Mel Eslyn\",\"Xan Aranda\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Alexandre Lehmann\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Mark Duplass\"]}]\t[\"Duplass Brothers Productions\",\"Netflix\",\"The Orchard\"]\t\t\t\t80\tBlue Jay is a romantic drama film directed by Alex Lehmann in his fictional feature debut, from a screenplay by Mark Duplass.

Natasha Lyonne stars as Megan Bloomfield, a high school cheerleader whose parents send her to a residential inpatient conversion therapy camp to cure her lesbianism. There, Megan soon comes to embrace her sexual orientation, despite the therapy, and falls in love. The supporting cast includes Joel Michaely, Melanie Lynskey, Dante Basco, Eddie Cibrian, Clea DuVall, Cathy Moriarty, Katrina Phillips, RuPaul, Richard Moll, Mink Stole, Kip Pardue, Michelle Williams, and Bud Cort.  But I'm a Cheerleader was Babbit's first feature film. It was inspired by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood familiarity with rehabilitation programs. She used the story of a young woman finding her sexual identity to explore the social construction of gender roles and heteronormativity. The costume and set design of the film highlighted these themes using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.  When it was initially rated as NC-17 by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), Babbit made cuts to allow it to be re-rated as R. When interviewed in the documentary film This Film Is Not Yet Rated Babbit criticized the MPAA for discriminating against films with gay content.  Many critics did not like the film, comparing it unfavorably with the films of John Waters and criticizing the colorful production design. Although the lead actors were praised for their performances, some of the characters were described as stereotypical. The film has since garnered a cult following.\n637\tBye Bye Birdie\t\t0\t13100000\t[\"Romance\",\"Musical\",\"Family\"]\tHQG94981\t1963\t1963-01-01 00:00:00\t695\t[\"Janet Leigh\",\"Dick Van Dyke\",\"Ann-Margret\",\"Maureen Stapleton\",\"Bobby Rydell\",\"Paul Lynde\",\"Michael Evans\",\"Frank Albertson\",\"Kim Darby\",\"Ed Sullivan\",\"Frank Sully\",\"Michael Evans\",\"Robert Paige\",\"Jesse Pearson\",\"Milton Frome\",\"Mary LaRoche\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Fred Kohlmar\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"George Sidney\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Irving Brecher\"]}]\t[\"Columbia Pictures\"]\t\t\t[\"Academy Award for Best Sound\",\"Academy Award for Best Score, Adaptation or Treatment\",\"Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy\",\"Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\"]\t105\tBye Bye Birdie is a 1963 American musical comedy film based on the 1960 stage production of the same name. The screenplay was adapted from Michael Stewart's book for the musical by Irving Brecher, with songs by composer Charles Strouse and lyricist Lee Adams, and a score by Johnny Green. Produced by Fred Kohlmar and directed by George Sidney, the film stars Dick Van Dyke in his feature film debut, reprising his Broadway role as Albert Peterson, along with Maureen Stapleton as Mae Peterson, Janet Leigh as Rosie DeLeon, Paul Lynde reprising his Broadway role as Harry MacAfee, Bobby Rydell as Hugo Peabody, and Ann-Margret as Kim MacAfee.  The story was inspired by the phenomenon of singer Elvis Presley being drafted into the United States Army in 1957. Jesse Pearson plays the role of teen idol Conrad Birdie, whose character name is a word play on country singer Conway Twitty, who was, at that time, a teen idol pop artist. Presley himself was the first choice for the role of Birdie, but his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, rejected the idea as he did not want Presley in any roles that were parodies of himself or his career. Ed Sullivan appears as himself, host of the popular long-running CBS variety show. The film is credited with making Ann-Margret a superstar during the mid-1960s, leading to her appearing with Elvis himself in Viva Las Vegas (1964).  In 2006, the film was ranked number 38 on Entertainment Weekly' s list of the 50 Best High School Movies.\n645\tCadillac Desert\t\t0.99\t\t[\"Documentary\"]\tOUQ51773\t1997\t1997-01-01 00:00:00\t21\t\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Jon H.

In April 1961, the rights to produce a film adaptation of Camelot were obtained by Warner Bros. with Lerner attached to write the screenplay. However, the film was temporarily shelved as the studio decided to adapt My Fair Lady into a feature film first. In 1966, development resumed with the hiring of Logan as director. Original cast members Richard Burton and Julie Andrews were approached to reprise their roles from the stage musical, but both declined and were replaced with Harris and Redgrave. Filming took place on location in Spain and on the Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank, California.

It is the sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and the ninth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo from a screenplay by the writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. It stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America alongside Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Cobie Smulders, Frank Grillo, Emily VanCamp, Hayley Atwell, Robert Redford, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Captain America joins forces with Black Widow and Falcon to uncover a conspiracy within the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. while facing a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier.  Markus and McFeely began writing the sequel around the release of The First Avenger in July 2011. The script draws from the Winter Soldier story arc in the comic books written by Ed Brubaker as well as conspiracy fiction from the 1970s such as Three Days of the Condor (1975). The film explores S.H.I.E.L.D., similarly to how the first film explored the U.S. military, after Rogers was shown working for the agency in the MCU crossover film The Avengers (2012). The Russo brothers signed to direct in June 2012 and casting began the following month. Filming began in April 2013 in Los Angeles, California, before moving to Washington, D.C., and Cleveland, Ohio. The directors used practical effects and intense stunt work, but also 2,500 visual effects shots created by six companies.  Captain America: The Winter Soldier premiered in Los Angeles on March 13, 2014, and was released in the United States on April 4, as part of Phase Two of the MCU. The film became a critical and commercial success, grossing over $714 million worldwide, making it the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2014, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. A sequel titled Captain America: Civil War , also directed by the Russos, was released in 2016.\n667\tCarol\t11800000\t3.99\t42800000\t[\"Romance\",\"Drama\",\"Family\"]\tJHI33208\t2015\t2015-01-01 00:00:00\t1159\t[\"Cate Blanchett\",\"Rooney Mara\",\"Kyle Chandler\",\"Sarah Paulson\",\"Cory Michael Smith\",\"Jake Lacy\",\"John Magaro\",\"Carrie Brownstein\",\"Dwight D.

The screenplay by Phyllis Nagy is based on the 1952 romance novel The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith (republished as Carol in 1990). The film stars Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Sarah Paulson, Jake Lacy, and Kyle Chandler. Set in New York City during the early 1950s, Carol tells the story of a forbidden affair between an aspiring female photographer and an older woman going through a difficult divorce.  Carol had been in development since 1997, when Nagy wrote the first draft of the screenplay. British company Film4 Productions and its then-chief executive Tessa Ross financed development. The film had a troubled development period, facing problems with financing, rights, scheduling conflicts, and accessibility. Number 9 Films came on board as a producer in 2011, when Elizabeth Karlsen secured the rights to the novel. The film is co-produced by New York-based Killer Films, which joined the project in 2013 after Haynes's collaborator Christine Vachon approached him to direct. Principal photography on the British-American production began in March 2014, in Cincinnati, Ohio, and lasted 34 days. Cinematographer Edward Lachman shot Carol on Super 16 mm film.  Carol premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 17, 2015, and was released in the United States on November 20 and in the United Kingdom on November 27. Grossing over $42 million on an $11 million budget, the film was praised for Haynes's direction and the performances of Blanchett and Mara, and was the best-reviewed film of 2015. Carol competed for the Palme d'Or at Cannes, where Mara tied with Emmanuelle Bercot for the Best Actress award. The film received many accolades, including five Golden Globe Award nominations, six Oscar nominations, and nine BAFTA Award nominations; as well as five Dorian Awards and awards from the New York Film Critics Circle, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and National Society of Film Critics. It featured prominently in several \"best of\" film lists, and was ranked by the British Film Institute as the best LGBT film of all time.\n674\tCasper\t55000000\t0.99\t287900000\t[\"Comedy\",\"Fantasy\",\"Family\"]\tZUF87699\t1995\t1995-05-26 00:00:00\t939\t[\"Bill Pullman\",\"Christina Ricci\",\"Devon Sawa\",\"Cathy Moriarty\",\"Eric Idle\",\"Amy Brenneman\",\"Chauncey Leopardi\",\"Ben Stein\",\"Brad Garrett\",\"Clint Eastwood\",\"Dan Aykroyd\",\"Don Novello\",\"Fred Rogers\",\"Joe Alaskey\",\"Malachi Pearson\",\"Mel Gibson\",\"Rodney Dangerfield\",\"Terry Murphy\",\"John Kassir\",\"Garette Ratliff Henson\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Gerald R.

The film stars Christina Ricci, Bill Pullman, Cathy Moriarty, Eric Idle, and also features the voices of Joe Nipote, Joe Alaskey, Brad Garrett and the introduction of Malachi Pearson in the title role.  The film makes extensive use of computer-generated imagery to create the ghosts, and it is the first feature film to have a fully CGI character in the lead role. It goes for a much darker interpretation of the Friendly Ghost in comparison to the comics, cartoons, and films of the previous years, especially with its theme of death, most notably providing the character a tragic backstory that addresses his death.  Casper was released in cinemas on May 26, 1995, by Universal Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the film for its faithfulness to its source material (specifically the title character's portrayal), visual effects, music score, and performances, but criticized its dark story and humor. The film earned $287.9 million on a $55 million budget, and went on to spawn two direct-to-video/made-for-TV follow-up films and an animated television spin-off, The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper.\n681\tCat on a Hot Tin Roof\t2300000\t0.99\t17600000\t[\"Drama\"]\tAGZ45937\t1959\t1959-01-01 00:00:00\t405\t[\"Elizabeth Taylor\",\"Paul Newman\",\"Burl Ives\",\"Jack Carson\",\"Judith Anderson\",\"Madeleine Sherwood\",\"Vaughn Taylor\",\"Larry Gates\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Lawrence Weingarten\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Richard Brooks\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Richard Brooks\",\"James Poe\"]}]\t[\"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\",\"KCET\"]\talcoholism\t[\"National Board of Review: Top Ten Films\"]\t[\"Academy Award for Best Picture\",\"Academy Award for Best Actor\",\"Academy Award for Best Actress\",\"Academy Award for Best Director\",\"Academy Award for Best Cinematography, Color\",\"Academy Award for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay\"]\t104\tCat on a Hot Tin Roof is a 1958 American drama film directed by Richard Brooks.

It tells the story of Roy Neary, an everyday blue-collar worker in Indiana, whose life changes after an encounter with an unidentified flying object (UFO).  Close Encounters was a long-cherished project for Spielberg. In late 1973, he developed a deal with Columbia Pictures for a science-fiction film. Though Spielberg received sole credit for the script, he was assisted by Paul Schrader, John Hill, David Giler, Hal Barwood, Matthew Robbins, and Jerry Belson, all of whom contributed to the screenplay in varying degrees. The title is derived from Ufologist J. Allen Hynek's classification of close encounters with extraterrestrials, in which the third kind denotes human observations of extraterrestrials or \"animate beings\". Douglas Trumbull served as the visual effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi designed the extraterrestrials.  Made on a production budget of $19.4 million, Close Encounters was released in a limited number of cities on November 16, 1977 and November 23, 1977 before expanding into wide release the following month. It was a critical and financial success, eventually grossing over $300 million worldwide. The film received numerous awards and nominations at the 50th Academy Awards, 32nd British Academy Film Awards, the 35th Golden Globe Awards and the 5th Saturn Awards, and has been widely acclaimed by the American Film Institute.  In December 2007, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. A Special Edition of the film, featuring both shortened and newly added scenes, was released theatrically in 1980. Spielberg agreed to do the special edition to add more scenes that they were unable to include in the original release, with the studio demanding a controversial scene depicting the interior of the extraterrestrial mothership. Spielberg's dissatisfaction with the altered ending scene led to a third version of the film, referred to as the Director's Cut , that was issued on VHS and LaserDisc in 1998 (and later DVD and Blu-ray). The director's cut is the longest version of the film, combining Spielberg's favorite elements from both previous editions but removing the scenes inside the extraterrestrial mothership. The film was later remastered in 4K and re-released in theatres on September 1, 2017 for its 40th anniversary.\n761\tCocoon\t17500000\t0\t85300000\t[\"Sci-Fi\",\"Fantasy\",\"Drama\",\"Comedy\"]\tOVP22390\t1985\t1985-06-21 00:00:00\t1174\t[\"Don Ameche\",\"Wilford Brimley\",\"Hume Cronyn\",\"Brian Dennehy\",\"Jack Gilford\",\"Steve Guttenberg\",\"Maureen Stapleton\",\"Jessica Tandy\",\"Gwen Verdon\",\"Herta Ware\",\"Tahnee Welch\",\"Barret Oliver\",\"Tyrone Power Jr.\",\"Clint Howard\",\"Linda Harrison\",\"Jim Fitzpatrick\",\"Rance Howard\",\"Harold Bergman\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Richard D.

It is based on Hugh Fleetwood's 1977 novel The Order of Death , with a screenplay by Fleetwood, Faenza and Ennio de Concini. The music was composed by Ennio Morricone. The plot follows a psychological cat-and-mouse game between a corrupt police officer (Keitel) and a disturbed young man (Lydon) against the backdrop of murders committed by a serial killer who is targeting police officers.  The film was shot on-location in New York City and at Cinecittà Studios in Rome between March and April, 1982. It is Lydon's only starring role in film to date. Upon release, it received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics, and has since fallen into the public domain. It has since undergone a reevaluation, and has become a cult classic due to the presence of Keitel and Lydon, while being acknowledged as a precursor to Abel Ferrara's similarly- themed Bad Lieutenant (1992).\n813\tCowards Bend the Knee\t\t1.99\t\t[\"Drama\",\"Film-Noir\"]\tQIT98816\t2003\t2003-01-01 00:00:00\t16\t[\"Darcy Fehr\",\"Amii Stewart\",\"Louis Negin\",\"Marion Martin\",\"Mike Bell\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Philip Monk\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Guy Maddin\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Guy Maddin\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t60\tCowards Bend the Knee (also known as The Blue Hands ) is a 2003 film by Guy Maddin.

Its final budget is estimated at $60,000. While initially unsuccessful with audiences, it was relatively well received by critics and continued to be shown in theaters as late as 1980. The home video revolution of the early 1980s helped the film achieve \"cult classic\" status, and O'Bannon collaborated with home video distributor VCI in the production of versions on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD.

The third film in Romero's Night of the Living Dead series, it stars Lori Cardille, Terry Alexander, Joseph Pilato and Richard Liberty as members of a group of survivors of a zombie apocalypse sheltering in an underground bunker in Florida, where they must determine the outcome of humanity's conflict with the undead horde. Romero described the film as a \"tragedy about how a lack of human communication causes chaos and collapse even in this small little pie slice of society.\"  Work on Day of the Dead began shortly after the release of the previous film in the series, Dawn of the Dead (1978). It was developed as part of a three- film deal with that film's distributor, United Film Distribution Company (UFDC); Romero elected to make the two other projects outlined in the deal, Knightriders (1981) and Creepshow (1982), first. Although the filmmaker was given final cut privilege, the screenplay was rewritten multiple times due to UFDC's concerns that Romero's ambitious original vision ― which he described as \"the Gone with the Wind of zombie films\" ― would need to be shot with the intention of receiving an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America to ensure its commercial viability; Romero elected to make the film on a lower budget and release it without a rating. Day of the Dead was filmed in fall 1984, with above-ground scenes in the cities of Fort Myers and Sanibel and underground scenes near Wampum, Pennsylvania. Tom Savini returned to provide the film's special make-up effects; he was assisted by a team of artists that included Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger, who later became known for their work on the television series The Walking Dead.   Day of the Dead premiered at Hicksville, New York on June 30, 1985, and grossed $34 million worldwide against a budget of approximately $4 million. Although the makeup effects were praised, the film initially did not match the critical and commercial success of its predecessors; the series did not see another instalment until the 2005 release of Land of the Dead. Reception of the film has improved with time, and Romero deemed it to be his personal favorite film in the original Dead trilogy. Like its predecessors, Day of the Dead has garnered a cult following and inspired numerous parodies and homages.  The film was remade twice: the first is the 2008 film of the same name, and the second is Day of the Dead: Bloodline (2018). A television series based on the film is set to air on Syfy in 2021, while a stand-alone sequel, Night of the Living Dead II , is in active development..\n892\tDead End Drive-In\t2500000\t3.99\t68000\t[\"Action\",\"Sci-Fi\",\"Fantasy\",\"Horror\"]\tGAJ35769\t1986\t1986-01-01 00:00:00\t35\t[\"Ned Manning\",\"Peter Whitford\",\"Wilbur Wilde\",\"David Gibson\",\"Murray Fahey\",\"Brett Climo\"]\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Brian Trenchard-Smith\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Peter Smalley\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t88\tDead End Drive-In is a 1986 Australian dystopian action film about a teenage couple trapped in a drive-in theatre which is really a concentration camp for societal rejects.

The film was directed by Brian Trenchard-Smith and stars Ned Manning and Natalie McCurry as the captive couple, and Peter Whitford as the manager of the drive-in.

It is the sixth and final Eon film to star Sean Connery, who returned to the role as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond, having declined to reprise the role in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969).  The film is based on Ian Fleming's 1956 novel of the same name and is the second of four James Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton. The story has Bond impersonating a diamond smuggler to infiltrate a smuggling ring and soon uncovering a plot by his old enemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld to use the diamonds to build a space-based laser weapon. Bond has to battle his enemy for one last time to stop the smuggling and stall Blofeld's plan of destroying Washington, D.C. and extorting the world with nuclear supremacy.  After George Lazenby left the series, producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli tested other actors, but studio United Artists wanted Sean Connery back, paying a then-record $1.25 million salary for him to return. The producers were inspired by Goldfinger ; as with that film, Guy Hamilton was hired to direct, and Shirley Bassey performed vocals on the title theme song. Locations included Las Vegas, California, and Amsterdam. Diamonds Are Forever was a commercial success and received generally positive reviews initially, but retrospective reviews criticized it for its humorous camp tone. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound.\n959\tDie Hard\t28000000\t3.99\t140767956\t[\"Action\",\"Thriller\",\"Family\"]\tCRG65513\t1988\t1988-07-15 00:00:00\t3018\t[\"Bruce Willis\",\"Alexander Godunov\",\"Bonnie Bedelia\",\"Reginald VelJohnson\",\"William Atherton\",\"Paul Gleason\",\"Al Leong\",\"Clarence Gilyard\",\"Robert Davi\",\"James Shigeta\",\"Anthony Peck\",\"Dennis Hayden\",\"Grand L.

It is based on the 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorp, and it stars Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Alexander Godunov, and Bonnie Bedelia. Die Hard follows New York City police detective John McClane (Willis) who is caught up in a terrorist takeover of a Los Angeles skyscraper while visiting his estranged wife. Reginald VelJohnson, William Atherton, Paul Gleason, and Hart Bochner feature in supporting roles.  Stuart was hired by 20th Century Fox to adapt Thorp's novel into a screenplay in 1987. His finished draft was greenlit immediately by Fox, who were eager for a summer blockbuster the following year. The role of McClane was turned down by a host of the decade's most popular actors, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. Known mainly for work on television, Willis was paid $5 million for his involvement, placing him among Hollywood's highest-paid actors. The deal was seen as a poor investment by industry professionals and attracted significant controversy before its release. Filming took place between November 1987 and March 1988, on a $25 million–$35 million budget and almost entirely on location in and around Fox Plaza in Los Angeles.  Expectations for Die Hard were low; some marketing efforts omitted Willis's image, ostensibly because the marketing team determined that the setting was as important as McClane. Upon its release in July 1988, initial reviews were mixed: criticism was focused on its violence, plot, and Willis's performance, while McTiernan's direction and Rickman's charismatic portrayal of the villain Hans Gruber were praised. Defying predictions, Die Hard grossed approximately $140 million, becoming the year's tenth-highest-grossing film and the highest-grossing action film. Receiving four Academy Award nominations, it elevated Willis to leading-man status and made Rickman a celebrity.  Die Hard has been critically re-evaluated and is now considered one of the greatest action films, and is also often named one of the best Christmas films. It revitalized the action genre, largely due to its depiction of McClane as a vulnerable and fallible protagonist, in contrast to the muscle- bound and invincible heroes of other films of the period. Retrospective commentators also identified and analyzed its thematic concerns, including vengeance, masculinity, gender roles, and American anxieties over foreign influences. The film produced a host of imitators; the term \" Die Hard \" became a shorthand for plots featuring overwhelming odds in a restricted environment, such as \" Die Hard on a bus\". It created a franchise comprising the sequels Die Hard 2 (1990), Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), Live Free or Die Hard (2007), and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013), plus video games, comics, and other merchandise. Deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress, Die Hard was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2017.\n966\tDim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart\t\t3.99\t\t[\"Unknown\"]\tZOG47659\t1985\t1985-01-01 00:00:00\t25\t[\"Victor Wong\",\"Cora Miao\",\"Joan Chen\",\"Amy Hill\"]\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Wayne Wang\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t88\tDim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart is a 1985 American comedy film directed by Wayne Wang and starring Laureen Chew, Kim Chew, Victor Wong, Ida F.

It is a thriller adapted from the 1971 short story by Daphne du Maurier. Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland portray a married couple who travel to Venice following the recent accidental death of their daughter, after the husband accepts a commission to restore a church. They encounter two sisters, one of whom claims to be clairvoyant and informs them that their daughter is trying to contact them and warn them of danger. The husband at first dismisses their claims, but starts to experience mysterious sightings himself.  Don't Look Now focuses on the psychology of grief and the effect the death of a child can have on a relationship. The film is renowned for its innovative editing style, recurring motifs and themes, and for a controversial sex scene that was explicit by the standards of contemporary mainstream cinema. It also employs flashbacks and flashforwards in keeping with the depiction of precognition, but some scenes are intercut or merged to alter the viewer's perception of what is really happening. It adopts an impressionist approach to its imagery, often presaging events with familiar objects, patterns and colours using associative editing techniques.  The film's reputation has grown in the years since its release and it is now considered a classic and an influential work in horror and British film.\n1002\tDope\t7000000\t0\t18000000\t[\"Family\",\"Crime\",\"Comedy\",\"Drama\"]\tORK75819\t2015\t2015-01-01 00:00:00\t406\t[\"Shameik Moore\",\"Tony Revolori\"]\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Rick Famuyiwa\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Rick Famuyiwa\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t103\tDope is a 2015 American comedy-drama coming-of-age film written and directed by Rick Famuyiwa and produced by Forest Whitaker and Nina Yang Bongiovi.

The film was based on the series of children's stories of the same name by Hugh Lofting, but used no material from any of the novels; the main connection is the name and a doctor who can speak to animals, although the Pushmi-Pullyu, a much-loved feature of the books, notably makes a very brief appearance in a couple of scenes. The first novel, The Story of Doctor Dolittle (1920) had originally and previously been filmed in 1967 as a musical of the same name, which was a closer (albeit still very loose) adaptation of the book. The 1967 film was a box office bomb, but became a cult classic.  Dr. Dolittle was a box office success, and was received warmly by audiences who praised its humor and themes. However it received mixed reviews from critics upon release. It has become a cult classic due to Murphy's performance. The film's success generated one theatrical sequel, Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001), and three films released direct to video: Dr. Dolittle 3 (2006), Dr. Dolittle: Tail to the Chief (2008), and Dr. Dolittle: Million Dollar Mutts (2009).\n1017\tDreamscape\t5000\t2.99\t\t[\"Sci-Fi\"]\tNGA47389\t2007\t2007-01-01 00:00:00\t3\t\t[]\t\t\t\t\t86\tDreamscape is a 2007 science fiction thriller style black-and-white film noir written and directed by Daniel J.

A Western revenge story in a contemporary setting, its plot concerns three punk rockers from New York City who attempt to make their way to California. When one of them is murdered by a vicious gang leader, the other two, played by Cryer and Roebuck, find themselves fish out of water as they pursue the murderer from Arizona to Montana, assisted by a tow truck driver played by Stewart.  Continuing Spheeris' theme of highlighting the punk subculture as in her prior films The Decline of Western Civilization (1981) and Suburbia (1984), Dudes features several rock musicians in various roles, including Fear singer Lee Ving as the gang leader, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea as the murdered punk, and John Densmore of the Doors, Axxel G. Reese of the Gears, and punk artist and promoter \"Mad\" Marc Rude in minor roles, as well as punk rock band the Vandals performing in the opening scene. Spheeris had previously worked with Ving in The Decline of Western Civilization , and with Flea and the Vandals in Suburbia.  Dudes was shown in only a few theaters and did not receive a wide release through a film distributor. Several parties involved in making the film, including Spheeris, later attributed this to its mixing of multiple genres and tones. Written as a dramatic, action-filled \"punk Western\" set in the modern era, the finished film also contained elements of comedy, road movies, and a heavy metal soundtrack, the combination of which made it difficult to market. It received a home video release on VHS, through which niche interest in the film persisted in subsequent decades. In 2017 it was given a new release in the DVD and Blu-ray formats.\n1040\tDutch Girls\t\t3.99\t\t[\"Comedy\"]\tQVE8214\t1985\t1985-01-01 00:00:00\t11\t[\"Bill Paterson\",\"Colin Firth\",\"Timothy Spall\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Sue Birtwistle\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Giles Foster\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"William Boyd\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t83\tDutch Girls is a 1985 film, released by the London Weekend Television Company, produced by Sue Birtwistle, directed by Giles Foster, and written by William Boyd.

Its plot is based on an incident in which one of Bolton's friends was dumped by his older boyfriend, because their parents did not approve of their age disparity.\n1061\tEducating Peter\t\t0.99\t\t[\"Documentary\"]\tXAD52666\t1992\t1992-01-01 00:00:00\t9\t\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Gerardine Wurzburg\"]}]\t\t\t[\"Academy Award for Best Documentary\"]\t[\"Academy Award for Best Documentary\"]\t30\tEducating Peter is a 1992 American short documentary film directed by Gerardine Wurzburg about Peter Gwazdauskas, a special needs student with Down syndrome, and his inclusion in a standard third grade classroom in Blacksburg, Virginia.

The film contends that there is a conspiracy in academia to oppress and exclude people who believe in intelligent design. It portrays the scientific theory of evolution as a contributor to communism, fascism, atheism, eugenics and, in particular, Nazi atrocities in the Holocaust. Although intelligent design is a pseudoscientific religious idea, the film presents it as science-based, without giving a detailed definition of the concept or attempting to explain it on a scientific level. Other than briefly addressing issues of irreducible complexity, Expelled examines intelligent design as a political issue.   Expelled opened in 1,052 movie theaters, more than any other documentary before it, and grossed over $2,900,000 in its first weekend. It earned $7.7 million, making it the 33rd highest-grossing documentary film in the United States (as of 2018, and not adjusted for inflation).  Media response to the film has been largely negative. Multiple reviews, including those of USA Today and Scientific American , described the film as propaganda, with USA Today adding that it was \"a political rant disguised as a serious commentary on stifled freedom of inquiry\" and Scientific American calling it \"a science-free attack on Darwin\". The New York Times deemed it \"a conspiracy-theory rant masquerading as investigative inquiry\" and \"an unprincipled propaganda piece that insults believers and nonbelievers alike\".\n1135\tF/X\t10000000\t4.99\t20600000\t[\"Crime\",\"Action\",\"Thriller\"]\tRTB57288\t1986\t1986-08-07 00:00:00\t183\t[\"Bryan Brown\",\"Brian Dennehy\",\"Diane Venora\",\"Jerry Orbach\",\"Joe Grifasi\",\"Tom Noonan\",\"Angela Bassett\",\"Cliff DeYoung\",\"Roscoe Orman\",\"Mason Adams\",\"Paul D'Amato\",\"James Pickens\",\"Trey Wilson\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Dodi Fayed\"]},{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"Giovanni Di Clemente\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Robert Mandel\"]}]\t[\"Orion Pictures\"]\t\t\t\t104\tF/X (also known as or subtitled Murder by Illusion ) is a 1986 American action thriller film directed by Robert Mandel, written by Gregory Fleeman and Robert T.

It features an ensemble cast including Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Ezra Miller, Zoë Kravitz, Callum Turner, Claudia Kim, William Nadylam, Kevin Guthrie, Jude Law and Johnny Depp. Set in 1927, it follows Newt Scamander and Albus Dumbledore as they attempt to take down the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald while facing new threats in a more divided wizarding world.  A second Fantastic Beasts film was announced in October 2014, and in July 2016 Rowling confirmed she had completed the script. Depp was cast in November 2016, causing some controversy due to domestic violence allegations recently made against him. Law signed on in April 2017. Principal photography began in July 2017 at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, in England. Filming also took place in London, Switzerland, and Paris, and wrapped in December 2017.  Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald premiered in Paris on 8 November 2018 and was released worldwide on 16 November 2018, in RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema, IMAX 3D, 4DX, IMAX, and ScreenX formats, by Warner Bros.

It received mixed reviews, with praise for its entertainment value, direction, and performances, but criticism of the \"needlessly complicated, low-stakes plot\", which some critics felt was \"overburdened\" with details setting up future sequels.   Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald was nominated for two awards at the 72nd British Academy Film Awards, in the categories of Best Production Design and Best Special Visual Effects.

It is the sequel to Fast & Furious (2009) and the fifth installment in the Fast & Furious franchise. It stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Tego Calderon, Don Omar, Gal Gadot, Dwayne Johnson, and Joaquim de Almeida. In the film, Dominic Toretto and Brian O'Conner recruit a team to steal $100 million from a corrupt businessman while being pursued for arrest by U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs.  While developing Fast Five , Universal Studios deliberately departed from the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as brawls, gun fights, and the central heist. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races.  Lin, Diesel, and Walker's returns were finalized in February 2010, and principal photography began that July and lasted until that October, with filming locations including Atlanta, Puerto Rico, and Rio de Janeiro. Brian Tyler, the composer of the previous two installments, returned to compose the score. The film is notable for primarily featuring practical stuntwork as opposed to computer-generated placements seen in other entries in the franchise.  Fast Five premiered in Rio de Janeiro on April 15, 2011, and was theatrically released worldwide on April 29. The film received generally positive reviews, with praise for Lin's direction, the action sequences, and Johnson's performance. Fast Five grossed over $625 million worldwide, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2011, the then-highest grossing film in the franchise, and set records related to Universal's highest-grossing opening weekend in several international markets. The sequel, Fast & Furious 6, was released in the United States on May 24, 2013.\n1163\tFatal Games\t\t3.99\t\t[\"Thriller\"]\tLTW44709\t1984\t1984-01-01 00:00:00\t18\t[\"Sean Masterson\",\"Michael O'Leary\",\"Spice Williams-Crosby\"]\t[]\t\t\t\t\t88\tFatal Games (originally known as The Killing Touch and also known as Olympic Nightmare ) is a 1984 American slasher film written and directed by Michael Elliott and starring Sally Kirkland, Lynn Banashek, Sean Masterson, Michael O'Leary, Teal Roberts, and Spice Williams-Crosby.

Based on the comic strip by R. Crumb and starring Skip Hinnant, the film focuses on Fritz (Hinnant), a glib, womanizing and fraudulent cat in an anthropomorphic animal version of New York City during the mid-to-late 1960s. Fritz decides on a whim to drop out of college, interacts with inner city African American crows, unintentionally starts a race riot, and becomes a leftist revolutionary. The film is a satire focusing on American college life of the era, race relations, the free love movement and serves as a criticism of the countercultural political revolution and dishonest political activists.  The film had a troubled production history, as Crumb, who is politically left- wing, had disagreements with the filmmakers over the film's political content, which he saw as being critical of the political left. Produced on a budget of $700,000, the film was intended by Bakshi to broaden the animation market. At that time period, animation was seen predominantly as a children's medium. Bakshi envisioned animation as being a medium that could tell more dramatic or satirical storylines with larger scopes, dealing with more mature and diverse themes that would resonate with adults. Bakshi also wanted to establish an independent alternative to the films produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, which dominated the animation market due to a lack of independent competition.  The intention of featuring profanity, sex and drug use, particularly cannabis, provoked criticism from more conservative members of the animation industry, who accused Bakshi of attempting to produce a pornographic animated film, as the concept of adult animation was not widely understood at the time. The Motion Picture Association of America gave the film an X rating, making it the first American animated film to receive the rating, which was then predominantly associated with more arthouse films.  The film was highly successful, grossing over $90 million worldwide, making it one of the most successful independent films of all time. It earned significant critical acclaim in 1970s, for its satire, social commentary and animations, although it also attracted some negative response accusing it of racial stereotyping and having an unfocused plot, and criticizing its depiction of graphic violence, profanity, sex and drug use in the context of an animated film. The film's use of satire and mature themes is seen as paving the way for future animated works for adults, including The Simpsons , South Park and Family Guy. A sequel, The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat (1974), was produced without Crumb's or Bakshi's involvement.\n1259\tFrozen\t150000000\t4.99\t1274219009\t[\"Comedy\",\"Musical\",\"Family\",\"Animation\",\"Fantasy\"]\tVJB79516\t2013\t2013-11-27 00:00:00\t3795\t\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Peter Del Vecho\",\"John Lasseter\"]},{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"John Lasseter\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Chris Buck\",\"Jennifer Lee\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Jennifer Lee\"]}]\t[\"Walt Disney Animation Studios\"]\tsister\t[\"Academy Award for Best Animated Feature\",\"Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film\",\"Annie Award for Best Animated Feature\",\"BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film\",\"Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature\",\"Saturn Award for Best Animated Film\"]\t[\"Academy Award for Best Animated Feature\"]\t101\tFrozen is a 2013 American computer-animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The 53rd Disney animated feature film, it is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale \"The Snow Queen\". The film depicts a princess who sets off on a journey alongside an iceman, his reindeer, and a snowman to find her estranged sister, whose icy powers have inadvertently trapped their kingdom in eternal winter.  Frozen underwent several story treatments before being commissioned in 2011 as a screenplay by Jennifer Lee, who co-directed with Chris Buck. The film features the voices of Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, Josh Gad, and Santino Fontana. Christophe Beck was hired to compose the film's orchestral score, while Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez wrote the songs. Frozen had its general theatrical release on November 27, 2013. It was praised for its visuals, screenplay, themes, music, and voice acting; some film critics consider Frozen to be Disney's best animated film since the studio's renaissance era. Frozen won a significant number of major awards, including the Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song, the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film, the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film, and two Grammy Awards.  During its theatrical run, the film was a significant commercial success, earning $1.280 billion in worldwide box office revenue. It also overtook Toy Story 3 to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time, and carried its position until it was overtaken by the remake of The Lion King in 2019. It also became the fifth highest-grossing film of all time and the highest- grossing film of 2013. By January 2015, the film became the best-selling Blu- ray Disc in the United States, which resulted in the film launching a franchise, including an animated short in 2015, an animated featurette in 2017, and a feature-length sequel, Frozen II , in November 2019.\n1267\tFunny Ha Ha\t\t3.99\t82620\t[\"Romance\"]\tZVI98112\t2002\t2002-01-01 00:00:00\t44\t[\"Kate Dollenmayer\",\"Christian Rudder\",\"Andrew Bujalski\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Ethan Vogt\",\"Hagai Shaham\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Andrew Bujalski\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Andrew Bujalski\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t89\tFunny Ha Ha is a 2002 American film written and directed by Andrew Bujalski.

The film was co-produced and released by DreamWorks Pictures and Universal Pictures. DreamWorks Pictures distributed the film in North America while Universal Pictures released it internationally through United International Pictures. It stars Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Ralf Möller, Oliver Reed (in his final role), Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, Richard Harris, and Tommy Flanagan. Crowe portrays Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when Commodus, the ambitious son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus becomes a gladiator and rises through the ranks of the arena to avenge the murders of his family and his emperor.  Inspired by Daniel P. Mannix's 1958 book Those About to Die (formerly titled The Way of the Gladiator ), the film's script, initially written by Franzoni, was acquired by DreamWorks and Ridley Scott signed on to direct the film. Principal photography began in January 1999, before the script was completed, and wrapped up in May of that year, with the scenes of Ancient Rome shot over a period of nineteen weeks in Fort Ricasoli, Malta. The film's computer-generated imagery effects were created by British post-production company The Mill, who also created a digital body double for the remaining scenes involving Reed's character Proximo due to Reed dying of a heart attack during production.  Gladiator premiered in Los Angeles on May 1, 2000, and was released theatrically in the United States on May 5 and in the United Kingdom on May 11. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the acting (particularly Crowe's and Phoenix's performances), Scott's direction, visuals, screenplay, action sequences, musical score and the production values. It was a box office success, grossing $187.7 million in the United States and grossed $457 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of 2000. The film won multiple awards, including five at the 73rd Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor for Crowe, Best Costume Design, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects. It also received four BAFTA Awards at the 54th British Academy Film Awards for Best Film, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design and Best Editing. Since its release, Gladiator has also been credited with reinventing the swords and sandals genre and rekindling interest in entertainment centered around ancient Greek and ancient Roman culture such as the television series Rome.\n1317\tGod's Not Dead\t2000000\t1.99\t64700000\t[\"Drama\"]\tDJF27776\t2014\t2014-03-21 00:00:00\t651\t[\"Shane Harper\",\"David A.

It received mostly negative reviews, but grossed over $62 million on a $2 million budget.

The female protagonist, Genie (played by actress Melinda Cordell, credited here as Melinda Plank), a talented ballet dancer, is made pregnant out of wedlock by her underachieving boyfriend, Brian (played by Robert Hogan (actor)), a would- be novelist. Rather than leave him in order to take up a professional dancing role she has been offered which involves touring, Genie stays in the flat they share, but Brian, after the damning rejection of his novel by a publisher upon whose patronage he was depending, absents himself for several days with an ex- girlfriend, Anne (played by Sunja Svensen), a society woman several years older who inhabits the periphery of bohemia, sometimes in the company of a genial young advertising copywriter, George (played by James Cresson).  Not aware that Genie is pregnant, Brian has made their marriage conditional upon his success as a writer. Genie fears that Brian, who is emotionally immature (something noted by the publishers in their dismissal of his submitted novel), will reject her out of hand on learning about her pregnancy. One possible solution is for Genie to visit an illegal abortionist, having sold her late mother's brooch to raise the cash. Meanwhile, Brian is informally mentored in the ways of the world by a more cynical and experienced bohemian, Norman (played by James Frawley), and tempted into the world of Madison Avenue by George, with whom he has struck up a friendship.  While away in the Berkshires with Anne, whose advances he gently shuns, Brian, still unaware of Genie's true condition, comes to the realisation that he loves and wants to marry her. He hurriedly returns to Greenwich Village, but Genie proves difficult to trace there.  The film was shot on location in Greenwich Village and The Berkshires, including a nude swimming scene filmed on Lake Garfield, Massachusetts. According to the director, the sounds of motorboat engines in this sequence threatened to take over the scene's audio and were replaced in the final soundtrack by pre-recorded crickets. The director himself had earlier worked as second assistant director on Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura (1960), while cinematographer Baird Bryant later worked as uncredited assistant to László Kovács on Easy Rider (1969), in which he was responsible for filming the LSD trip sequence in the cemetery in New Orleans.\n1366\tGround Control\t\t0.99\t\t[\"Thriller\",\"Horror\",\"Drama\"]\tEDX59436\t1998\t1998-01-01 00:00:00\t28\t[\"Kiefer Sutherland\",\"Bruce McGill\",\"Kristy Swanson\",\"Robert Sean Leonard\",\"Kelly McGillis\",\"Margaret Cho\",\"Henry Winkler\",\"Charles Fleischer\",\"Farrah Forke\",\"Michael Gross\",\"Jack Plotnick\",\"John Bennett Perry\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Peter Block\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Richard Howard\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Mark Shepard\"]}]\t\taviation\t\t\t94\tGround Control (  Jet ) is a 1998 American disaster thriller film directed by Richard Howard and starring Kiefer Sutherland, Bruce McGill, Kristy Swanson, and Robert Sean Leonard.

Hart and Malia Scotch Marmo. It stars Robin Williams as Peter Banning / Peter Pan, Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook, Julia Roberts as Tinker Bell, Bob Hoskins as Mr. Smee, and Maggie Smith as Granny Wendy. It acts as a sequel to J. M. Barrie's 1911 novel Peter and Wendy focusing on an adult Peter Pan who has forgotten all about his childhood. In his new life, he is known as Peter Banning, a successful but unimaginative and workaholic lawyer with a wife (Wendy's granddaughter) and two children. However, when Captain Hook, the enemy of his past, kidnaps his children, he returns to Neverland to save them. Along the journey, he reclaims the memories of his past and becomes a better person.  Spielberg began developing the film in the early 1980s with Walt Disney Pictures and Paramount Pictures, which would have followed the storyline seen in the 1924 silent film and 1953 animated Disney film. It entered pre- production in 1985, but Spielberg abandoned the project. Hart developed the script with director Nick Castle and TriStar Pictures before Spielberg decided to direct in 1989. It was shot almost entirely on sound stages at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California.  Released on December 11, 1991, Hook received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances (particularly those of Williams and Hoffman), John Williams' musical score, and production values, but criticized the screenplay and tone. Although it was a commercial success, its box office take was lower than expected. Spielberg also later came to be disappointed with the film. It has gained a strong cult following since its release. It was nominated in five categories at the 64th Academy Awards. It also spawned merchandise, including video games, action figures, and comic book adaptations.\n1511\tHouse II: The Second Story\t3000000\t2.99\t10000000\t[\"Horror\",\"Thriller\"]\tNPQ75283\t1987\t1987-01-01 00:00:00\t155\t[\"Arye Gross\",\"Jonathan Stark\",\"Royal Dano\",\"Bill Maher\",\"John Ratzenberger\",\"Jonathan Stark\",\"Amy Yasbeck\",\"Mitzi Kapture\",\"David Arnott\",\"Kane Hodder\",\"Gil Birmingham\",\"Devin DeVasquez\",\"Gregory Walcott\",\"Lar Park Lincoln\",\"Dwier Brown\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Sean S.

Released and taking place nineteen years after the previous film, it is set in 1957, pitting Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) against Soviet agents led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett)—searching for a telepathic crystal skull. Jones is aided by his former lover, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), and her son, Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf). Ray Winstone, John Hurt, and Jim Broadbent are also part of the supporting cast.  Screenwriters Jeb Stuart, Jeffrey Boam, Frank Darabont, George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson wrote drafts before David Koepp's script satisfied the producers. The filmmakers intended to pay tribute to the science fiction B-movies of the 1950s era. Shooting began on June 18, 2007, at various locations in New Mexico, New Haven, Connecticut, Hawaii, and Fresno, California, as well as on sound stages in Los Angeles. To maintain aesthetic continuity with the previous films, the crew relied on traditional stunt work instead of computer- generated stunt doubles, and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński studied Douglas Slocombe's style from the previous films.  The film premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2008, and was released worldwide on May 22, 2008. It received generally positive reviews from critics but more polarized responses from audiences. Critics praised the film for its visual effects, performances, action sequences, John Williams' musical score, and the costume design, but criticized the dialogue, storyline, pacing, and overuse of CGI. It was also a financial success like the previous three films in the series, grossing over $790 million worldwide, becoming the franchise's highest-grossing film when not adjusted for inflation, as well as the second-highest-grossing film of 2008.  Paramount sold the distribution rights of future films in the Indiana Jones franchise to The Walt Disney Company in December 2013, following its acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012, with Paramount still retaining this film and its predecessors and receiving \"financial participation\" from any additional films beginning with the fifth film, which is scheduled for release on July 29, 2022, with Ford set to reprise his role.\n1627\tInside/Out\t\t4.99\t\t[\"Unknown\"]\tEYK37307\t1997\t1997-01-01 00:00:00\t2\t[\"Stefania Rocca\",\"Mikkel Gaup\",\"Frédéric Pierrot\",\"Bérangère Allaux\"]\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Robert Tregenza\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Robert Tregenza\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t115\tInside/Out is a 1997 American drama film directed by Rob Tregenza.

The film, starring Spencer Tracy with an all- star cast of comedians, is about the madcap pursuit of $350,000 in stolen cash by a diverse and colorful group of strangers. It premiered on November 7, 1963. The principal cast features Edie Adams, Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Buddy Hackett, Ethel Merman, Dorothy Provine, Mickey Rooney, Dick Shawn, Phil Silvers, Terry-Thomas, and Jonathan Winters.  The film marked the first time Kramer directed a comedy, though he had produced the comedy So This Is New York in 1948. He is best known for producing and directing, in his own words, \"heavy drama\" about social problems, such as The Defiant Ones , Inherit the Wind , Judgment at Nuremberg , and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. His first attempt at directing a comedy film paid off immensely as It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World became a critical and commercial success in 1963 and was nominated for six Academy Awards, winning for Best Sound Editing, and two Golden Globe Awards.  The film suffered severe cuts by its distributor United Artists in order to give the film a shorter running time for its general release. The footage was excised against Kramer's wishes. On October 15, 2013, it was announced that the Criterion Collection had collaborated with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, United Artists, and film restoration expert Robert A. Harris to reconstruct and restore It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World to be as close as possible to the original 202-minute version envisioned by Kramer.

Rather than writing a traditional screenplay, he and Ben York Jones compiled a 50-page outline of the film from which the actors improvised almost all of the dialogue. Filming took place over four weeks in Los Angeles and London with a budget of $250,000.  Like Crazy premiered on January 22, 2011 at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won the festival's Grand Jury Prize. It was released in theaters on October 28, 2011 and grossed over $3.7 million at the box office. Most reviews of the film were positive, with reviewers giving particular praise to the performances of Yelchin and Jones, although some found the plot unrealistic and contrived.\n1862\tLioness\t\t0\t\t[\"Documentary\"]\tETG86261\t2008\t2008-01-01 00:00:00\t4\t\t[]\t\t\t\t\t82\tLioness is a 2008 documentary film directed by Meg McLagan and Daria Sommers about the first members of Team Lioness. This feature-length documentary tells the story of a group of Army servicewomen who went to Iraq as clerks, mechanics and engineers but ended up fighting alongside the Marines in some of the bloodiest battles of the Iraq war.  Told through intimate accounts, journal excerpts, archival footage, as well as interviews with military commanders, the film follows five women who were part of an unofficial program called \"Team Lioness.\" The women's candid narratives, coupled with scenes from their lives back home, form a portrait of the emotional and psychological effects of war from a female point of view  As the first film to shed light on the hidden narrative of women in combat, Lioness interceded in public dialogues about gender and the military, leading to tangible change in a number of arenas by framing an important but largely invisible issue in meaningful, human terms. The film played an important role in influencing legislation and policy discussions in Congress, the VA, and the Department of Defense and was embraced by a national movement of activists and veteran service organizations working to improve care for the unprecedented influx of women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan into the VA system.\n1869\tLittle Fish, Strange Pond\t485000\t4.99\t\t[\"Comedy\"]\tBMC87459\t2009\t2009-01-01 00:00:00\t11\t[\"Matthew Modine\",\"Callum Blue\",\"Paul Adelstein\",\"Adam Baldwin\",\"Zach Galifianakis\",\"Liza Weil\",\"Lisa Brenner\",\"David Ellison\",\"Don McManus\"]\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Gregory Dark\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t80\tLittle Fish, Strange Pond (alternate title: Frenemy ) is a 2009 direct-to-DVD indie film directed by Gregory Dark and written by Robert Dean Klein.\n1876\tLittle Sister\t\t0.99\t\t[\"Comedy\"]\tEZK52458\t2016\t2016-03-12 00:00:00\t38\t[\"Addison Timlin\"]\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Zach Clark\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Zach Clark\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t91\tLittle Sister is a 2016 American dark comedy film written and directed by Zach Clark.

It is the second screen adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's 1955 novel of the same name and stars Jeremy Irons as Humbert Humbert and Dominique Swain as Dolores \"Lolita\" Haze, with supporting roles by Melanie Griffith as Charlotte Haze, and Frank Langella as Clare Quilty. The film is about a middle-aged male professor, Humbert, who rents a room in the house of the widow Charlotte Haze and becomes sexually attracted to her adolescent daughter Dolores, also called \"Lo\" or \"Lolita\".  Lyne's film is more overt with many of the novel's darker elements compared to Stanley Kubrick's 1962 version, which used suggestion and innuendo for comic purposes.  The film had difficulty finding an American distributor and premiered in Europe before being released in the United States. The film was eventually picked up in the United States by Showtime, a cable network, before finally being released theatrically by The Samuel Goldwyn Company. Although praised by some critics for its faithfulness to Nabokov's narrative and for the performances of Irons and Swain, the film received a mixed critical reception in the United States. Lolita was met with much controversy in Australia, where it was not given a theatrical release until April 1999.\n1900\tLooking Glass\t\t0\t\t[\"Thriller\"]\tOKC97292\t2018\t2018-02-16 00:00:00\t251\t[\"Nicolas Cage\",\"Robin Tunney\",\"Marc Blucas\",\"Ernie Lively\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Cameron Jones\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Tim Hunter\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Jerry Rapp\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t103\tLooking Glass is a 2018 American thriller film directed by Tim Hunter and starring Nicolas Cage.

Teri Polo and Owen Wilson also star.  The film is a remake of a 1992 film of the same name directed by Greg Glienna and produced by Jim Vincent. Glienna- who also played the original one's main protagonist- and Mary Ruth Clarke cowrote the screenplay. Universal Pictures purchased the rights to Glienna's film with the intent of creating a new version. Jim Herzfeld expanded the original script but development was halted for some time. Jay Roach read the expanded script and expressed his desire to direct it but Universal declined him. At that time, Steven Spielberg was interested in doing so while Jim Carrey was interested in playing the lead role. The studio only offered the film to Roach once Spielberg and Carrey left the project.  Released in the United States and Canada on October 6, 2000 and distributed by Universal Pictures, the film earned back its initial budget of $55 million in only 11 days. It went on to become one of the highest-grossing films of 2000, earning over $165 million in North America and over $330 million worldwide. It was well received by film critics and viewers alike, winning several awards and earning additional nominations. Ben Stiller won two comedy awards for his performance and the film was chosen as the Favorite Comedy Motion Picture at the 2001 People's Choice Awards. The success of the film inspired two sequels, namely Meet the Fockers and Little Fockers released in 2004 and 2010, respectively. It also inspired a reality television show titled Meet My Folks and a situation comedy titled In-Laws , both of which debuted on NBC in 2002.\n2026\tMegafault\t1200000\t4.99\t\t[\"Action\",\"Sci-Fi\",\"Horror\"]\tGXP80218\t2009\t2009-01-01 00:00:00\t29\t[\"Brittany Murphy\",\"Eriq La Salle\",\"Justin Hartley\",\"Bruce Davison\",\"Tamala Jones\",\"Paul Logan\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"David Michael Latt\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"David Michael Latt\"]}]\t[\"The Asylum\"]\t\t\t\t90\tMegaFault is a 2009 television disaster film by The Asylum, directed by David Michael Latt, starring Brittany Murphy, Justin Hartley, Eriq Lasalle, Tamala Jones, Paul Logan and Bruce Davison.

The film's script was based on a pitch by Jonathan Nolan, who wrote the 2001 story \"Memento Mori\" from the concept. Guy Pearce stars as a man who, as a result of an injury, has anterograde amnesia (the inability to form new memories) and has short-term memory loss approximately every fifteen minutes. He is searching for the people who attacked him and killed his wife, using an intricate system of Polaroid photographs and tattoos to track information he cannot remember.  The film is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film: a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist). The two sequences meet at the end of the film, producing one complete and cohesive narrative.   Memento premiered at the 57th Venice International Film Festival on September 5, 2000, and was released in the United States on March 16, 2001. It was acclaimed by critics, who praised its nonlinear narrative structure and motifs of memory, perception, grief, and self-deception, and it earned $40 million over its $4.5 million budget. Memento received numerous accolades, including Oscar nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. The film is now widely regarded as one of Nolan's finest works and one of the best films of the 2000s. In 2017, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n2042\tMen with Guns\t2300000\t3.99\t910773\t[\"Drama\"]\tTMM55448\t1997\t1997-01-01 00:00:00\t36\t[\"Federico Luppi\",\"Damián Delgado\",\"Damián Alcázar\",\"Mandy Patinkin\"]\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"John Sayles\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"John Sayles\"]}]\t[\"IFC\"]\t\t\t\t126\tMen with Guns (Spanish: Hombres armados ) is a 1997 American drama film written and directed by John Sayles and starring Federico Luppi, Damián Delgado, Damián Alcázar and Mandy Patinkin.

It features Rock Hudson, Doris Day, Tony Randall, Thelma Ritter, and Nick Adams. The film was written by Russell Rouse, Maurice Richlin, Stanley Shapiro, and Clarence Greene.  It tells the story of Jan Morrow (Day), an interior decorator and Brad Allen (Hudson), a womanizing composer/bachelor, who share a telephone party line. When she unsuccessfully files a complaint on him for constantly using the line to woo his conquests, Brad decides to take a chance on Jan by masquerading as a Texas rancher, resulting in the two falling in love. The scheme seems to work until Brad's mutual friend and Jan's client Jonathan Forbes (Randall) finds out about this, causing a love triangle in the process.  According to a \"Rambling Reporter\" (August 28, 1959) item in The Hollywood Reporter , RKO originally bought the script by Russell Rouse and Clarence Greene in 1942, but since it was not produced, the writers bought it back in 1945. In 1947, they sold it as a play, but bought it back once again four years later, finally selling it in 1958 to Arwin Productions, the company owned by Doris Day's husband, Martin Melcher. Although the film was originally titled Pillow Talk , according to a February 2, 1959 \"Rambling Reporter\" item in The Hollywood Reporter , the title \"displeased\" the PCA, and was changed to Any Way the Wind Blows. In August 1959, however, the original title was reinstated.  The film won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, and was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Doris Day), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Thelma Ritter), Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color (Richard H. Riedel, Russell A. Gausman, Ruby R. Levitt) and Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture.  This is the first of three romantic comedies in which Day, Hudson and Randall starred together, the other two being Lover Come Back (1961) and Send Me No Flowers (1964).  Upon its release, Pillow Talk brought in a then staggering domestic box- office gross of $18,750,000 and gave Rock Hudson's career a comeback after the failure of A Farewell to Arms two years earlier.  On July 14, 1980, Jack Martin reported on Pillow Talk as \"biggest hit of 1959\".  In 2009, it was entered into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant and preserved.\n2376\tPirates of Treasure Island\t1500000\t0\t\t[\"Comedy\",\"Adventure\"]\tLUB51273\t2006\t2006-01-01 00:00:00\t43\t[\"Lance Henriksen\",\"Tom Nagel\",\"Leigh Scott\",\"Rebekah Kochan\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Paul Bales\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Leigh Scott\"]}]\t[\"The Asylum\"]\tsea piracy\t\t\t80\tPirates of Treasure Island is a 2006 American comedy-drama film produced by The Asylum, loosely adapted from Robert Louis Stevenson's 1883 novel Treasure Island.

It features supporting performances from Casey Stevens, Eddie Benton, Mary Beth Rubens and Michael Tough.  Prom Night was filmed in Toronto in late 1979 on a budget of $1.5 million. Distributed by AVCO Embassy Pictures, it premiered in the United States in July 1980 in select cities, and was an immediate financial success. Its release platform expanded to major cities such as Los Angeles and New York in August, where it was again met with high box-office receipts. At the time, the film was AVCO Embassy's most financially successful release, breaking weekend records in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and New England.  By the end of its theatrical run, Prom Night had grossed $15 million in the United States, and was Canada's highest-earning horror film of 1980. Critical reaction to the film varied, with some, such as Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, dismissing it for its depictions of violence against women, while others alternately praised the film for its more muted violent content. Prom Night received some critical accolades, garnering Genie Award nominations for editing and for Curtis's leading performance. An alternative cut of the film was popularly aired on American and Canadian television networks in 1981.  In the intervening years, Prom Night has accrued a substantial cult following, not only for its horror content but also for its disco-heavy soundtrack, which was released by RCA Records in Japan in 1980. Some film scholars have cited Prom Night as one of the most influential slasher films of the period. Several companies released the film on video, and it was distributed on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 1998.

It was the eighth film produced by Pixar and was written and directed by Brad Bird, who took over from Jan Pinkava in 2005, and produced by Brad Lewis, from an original idea from Bird, Pinkava and Jim Capobianco. The title refers to the French dish ratatouille, which is served at the end of the film, and also references the animal type of the main character, a rat. The plot follows the rat named Remy, who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to achieve his goal by forming an alliance with a Parisian restaurant's garbage boy.  The film stars the voices of Patton Oswalt as Remy, an anthropomorphic rat who is interested in cooking; Lou Romano as Alfredo Linguini, a young garbage boy who befriends Remy; Ian Holm as Skinner, the head chef of Auguste Gusteau's restaurant; Janeane Garofalo as Colette Tatou, a rôtisseur at Gusteau's restaurant and the staff's only female chef; Peter O'Toole as Anton Ego, a restaurant critic; Brian Dennehy as Django, Remy's father and leader of his clan; Peter Sohn as Emile, Remy's older brother; and Brad Garrett as Auguste Gusteau, a recently deceased chef.  The development of Ratatouille began in 2000 when Pinkava wrote the original concepts of the film. In 2005, following Pinkava's departure from Pixar, Bird was approached to direct the film and revise the story. Bird and some of the film's crew members also visited Paris for inspiration. To create the food animation used in the film, the crew consulted chefs from both France and the United States. Lewis interned at Thomas Keller's The French Laundry restaurant, where Keller developed the confit byaldi, a dish used in the film. Michael Giacchino composed the Paris-inspired music for the film.  Ratatouille premiered on June 22, 2007, at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles, California, with its general release June 29, 2007, in the United States. The film grossed $620.7 million and received widespread critical acclaim for its screenplay, animation, voice performances, and Michael Giacchino's score. It also won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for several more, including Best Original Screenplay. Ratatouille was later voted one of the 100 greatest motion pictures of the 21st century by a 2016 poll of international critics conducted by the BBC.\n2493\tReal Fiction\t\t3.99\t\t[\"Crime\",\"Drama\"]\tBCW15316\t2000\t2000-01-01 00:00:00\t10\t[\"Joo Jin-mo\",\"Shim I-yeong\"]\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Kim Ki-duk\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Kim Ki-duk\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t84\tReal Fiction (Korean: 실제 상황; RR: Silje Sanghwang ; lit. \"State of Reality\") is a 2000 crime-drama film from South Korean director Kim Ki-duk.

It is based on the 1982 historical fiction novel Schindler's Ark by Australian novelist Thomas Keneally. The film follows Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who together with his wife Emilie Schindler saved more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees from the Holocaust by employing them in his factories during World War II. It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as SS officer Amon Göth and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.  Ideas for a film about the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden , made it his life's mission to tell Schindler's story. Spielberg became interested when executive Sidney Sheinberg sent him a book review of Schindler's Ark. Universal Pictures bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several directors before deciding to direct it.  Principal photography took place in Kraków, Poland, over 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot in black and white and approached the film as a documentary. Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński wanted to create a sense of timelessness. John Williams composed the score, and violinist Itzhak Perlman performed the main theme.  Schindler's List premiered on November 30, 1993, in Washington, D.C. and was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States. Often listed among the greatest films ever made, the film received international acclaim from critics for its tone, Spielberg's direction, acting (especially Fiennes and Neeson), and atmosphere; it was also a box office success, earning $322 million worldwide on a $22 million budget. It was nominated for twelve Academy Awards, winning seven, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score, and won numerous other awards, including seven BAFTAs and three Golden Globe Awards. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked Schindler's List 8th on its list of the 100 best American films of all time. The film was designated as \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress in 2004 and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n2628\tScotland Yet\t28000\t1.99\t\t[\"Documentary\"]\tOSL86932\t2014\t2014-01-01 00:00:00\t1\t\t[]\t\t\t\t\t92\tScotland Yet is a 2014 documentary film directed by Scottish filmmaker and journalist Jack Foster, and produced by Christopher Silver. The film focuses on the more obscure grassroots elements of the Scottish independence campaign, concentrated primarily on those arguing for a Yes vote in the 2014 referendum; the film's tagline is “a film about independence.”  The title of the film alludes to a song by the late Scottish folk singer and songwriter Davy Steele, called ‘Scotland Yet’, written at the time of the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum. Various interpretations of the song feature in the film's soundtrack, created by traditional musicians Rona Wilkie and Marit Fält.

Directed by Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury, and Conrad Vernon, it is the sequel to Shrek (2001) and the second installment in the Shrek film franchise. The film stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz, who reprise their respective voice roles of Shrek, Donkey, and Fiona. They are joined by new characters voiced by Antonio Banderas, Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Rupert Everett, and Jennifer Saunders. Like its predecessor, Shrek 2 also parodies other films based on fairy tales and features references to American popular culture. Shrek 2 takes place following the events of the first film, with Shrek and Donkey meeting Fiona's parents as her zealous Fairy Godmother, who wants Fiona to marry her son Prince Charming, plots to destroy Shrek and Fiona's marriage. Shrek and Donkey team up with a swashbuckling cat named Puss in Boots to foil her plans.  Development began in 2001, and following disagreements with producers, the first film's screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio were replaced with Adamson. The story was inspired by Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), and new animation tools were utilized to improve the visual appearance of each character, particularly Puss in Boots. The lead actors also received a significant bump in salary to $10 million, which at the time was among the highest contracts in their respective careers.  Shrek 2 premiered at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or, and it was released in theaters on May 19, 2004. Met with highly favorable reviews, like its predecessor, the film grossed US$919.8 million worldwide. It scored the second-largest three-day opening weekend in U.S. history and the largest opening for an animated film at the time of its release. It went on to become the highest-grossing film of 2004 worldwide. Shrek 2 is also DreamWorks Animation's most successful film to date, and it held the title of being the highest-grossing animated film of all time worldwide until Toy Story 3 surpassed it in 2010. The film received two Academy Award nominations for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song, and its associated soundtrack charted in the Top 10 on the US Billboard 200\\. A sequel to the film, Shrek the Third , was released in May 2007.\n2706\tSick: Survive the Night\t\t3.99\t\t[\"Horror\",\"Thriller\",\"Fantasy\"]\tJGX78273\t2012\t2012-01-01 00:00:00\t6\t\t[]\t\t\t\t\t\tSick: Survive the Night is a 2012 Canadian horror film directed by Ryan M.

The film is the third to star Daniel Craig as fictional MI6 agent James Bond and features Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva, the villain, and Judi Dench as M. It was directed by Sam Mendes and written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan and features the theme song \"Skyfall\", written and performed by Adele. It was theatrically distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. The story centres on Bond investigating an attack on MI6 that leads to a wider plot by former agent Raoul Silva to discredit and kill M as revenge for abandoning him. It sees the return of two recurring characters after an absence of two films: Q, played by Ben Whishaw, and Miss Moneypenny, played by Naomie Harris.  Mendes was approached to direct after the release of Quantum of Solace in 2008. Development was suspended when MGM ran into financial trouble, and did not resume until MGM emerged from bankruptcy in December 2010; meanwhile the original screenwriter, Peter Morgan, left the project. When production resumed, Logan, Purvis, and Wade continued writing what became the final version. Filming began in November 2011, primarily in the United Kingdom, with smaller portions shot in China and Turkey.  Skyfall premiered at the Royal Albert Hall, London, on 23 October 2012 and was released in the UK on 26 October and in North America on 9 November. It was the first James Bond film to be screened in IMAX venues, although it was not filmed with IMAX cameras. The release coincided with the 50th anniversary of the series, which began with Dr. No in 1962. Skyfall won several accolades, including two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, and two Grammy Awards. It was the fourteenth film to gross over $1 billion worldwide, and the only James Bond film to do so. It became the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing film in the UK, the highest-grossing film in the series, the highest-grossing film worldwide for both Sony Pictures and MGM, and the second-highest-grossing film of 2012.  The next film in the series, Spectre , was released in North America in November 2015, with Craig reprising his role, Sony Pictures returning to distribute, and Mendes returning to direct.\n2751\tSlow Burn\t15500000\t0.99\t1797256\t[\"Thriller\"]\tCZX48031\t2005\t2005-01-01 00:00:00\t41\t[\"Ray Liotta\",\"Jolene Blalock\",\"LL Cool J\",\"Mekhi Phifer\",\"Taye Diggs\",\"Bruce McGill\",\"Chiwetel Ejiofor\",\"Guy Torry\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Sidney Kimmel\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Wayne Beach\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t93\tSlow Burn is a 2005 American drama thriller film directed by Wayne Beach and starring Ray Liotta, Jolene Blalock and LL Cool J.

The film follows Johnny Marco (played by Stephen Dorff), a newly famous actor, as he recuperates from a minor injury at the Chateau Marmont, a well-known Hollywood retreat. Despite money, fame and professional success, Marco is trapped in an existential crisis and has an emotionally empty daily life. When his ex-wife suffers an unexplained breakdown and goes away, she leaves Cleo (Elle Fanning), their 11-year-old daughter, in his care. They spend time together and her presence helps Marco mature and accept adult responsibility. The film explores ennui among Hollywood stars, the father–daughter relationship and offers an oblique comedy of show business, particularly Hollywood film-making and the life of a \"star\".  Somewhere premiered at the 67th Venice International Film Festival where it received the Golden Lion award for best picture. Critical opinion was mildly positive. Reviewers praised the patience of the film's visual style and its empathy for a handful of characters, but some found Somewhere to be too repetitive of themes in Coppola's previous work, or did not sympathize with the protagonist because of his relative success. It was released to theaters in the United Kingdom and Ireland on December 10, 2010, and in the United States on December 22, 2010.\n2788\tSorority Row\t12500000\t4.99\t27200000\t[\"Horror\",\"Thriller\"]\tXKM16506\t2009\t2009-09-09 00:00:00\t409\t[\"Briana Evigan\",\"Leah Pipes\",\"Rumer Willis\",\"Jamie Chung\",\"Audrina Patridge\",\"Julian Morris\",\"Margo Harshman\",\"Matt Lanter\",\"Carrie Fisher\",\"Matt O'Leary\"]\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Stewart Hendler\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Josh Stolberg\",\"Pete Goldfinger\"]}]\t[\"Summit Entertainment\",\"Entertainment One\"]\t\t\t\t101\tSorority Row is a 2009 American slasher film directed by Stewart Hendler and starring Briana Evigan, Leah Pipes, Rumer Willis, and Carrie Fisher.

Discussions for a sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming began by October 2016, and the project was confirmed later that year. Holland, Watts, and the writers were all set to return by the end of 2017. In 2018, Jackson and Gyllenhaal joined the cast as Fury and Mysterio, respectively. Holland revealed the sequel's title ahead of filming, which began that July and took place in England, the Czech Republic, Italy, and the New York metropolitan area.

It is the third film in the Star Trek franchise, and is the second part of a three-film story arc that begins with Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) and concludes with Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986). After the death of Spock (Nimoy), the crew of the USS Enterprise returns to Earth. When James T. Kirk (William Shatner) learns that Spock's spirit, or katra, is held in the mind of Dr. Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Kirk and company steal the Enterprise to return Spock's body to his homeworld. The crew must also contend with hostile Klingons led by Kruge (Christopher Lloyd) who are bent on stealing the secrets of a powerful terraforming device.  Paramount Pictures commissioned the film after the positive critical and commercial reaction to The Wrath of Khan. Nimoy directed the film, becoming the first Star Trek cast member to do so. Producer Harve Bennett wrote the script starting from the end and working back, and intended the destruction of the Enterprise to be a shocking development. Bennett and Nimoy collaborated with effects house Industrial Light & Magic to develop storyboards and new ship designs; ILM also handled the film's many special effects sequences. Aside from a single day of location shooting, all of the film's scenes were shot on Paramount and ILM soundstages. Composer James Horner returned to expand his themes from the previous film.  The Search for Spock opened on June 1, 1984. In its first week of release, the film grossed over $16 million from almost 2,000 theaters across North America. It went on to gross $76 million at the domestic box office, with a total of $87 million worldwide. Critical reaction to The Search for Spock was positive, but notably less so than the previous film. Reviewers generally praised the cast and characters, while criticism tended to focus on the plot; the special effects were conflictingly received. Roger Ebert called the film a compromise between the tones of the first and second Star Trek films.\n2836\tStar Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope\t11000000\t4.99\t775512064\t[\"Musical\",\"Sci-Fi\",\"Action\",\"Adventure\",\"Fantasy\",\"Family\"]\tLAM79371\t1977\t1977-05-25 00:00:00\t4055\t[\"Harrison Ford\",\"Alec Guinness\",\"Carrie Fisher\",\"Mark Hamill\",\"Peter Cushing\",\"Peter Mayhew\",\"David Prowse\",\"Anthony Daniels\",\"Kenny Baker\",\"Denis Lawson\",\"Richard LeParmentier\",\"Phil Brown\",\"Shelagh Fraser\",\"William Hootkins\",\"Eddie Byrne\",\"Robert Clarke\",\"James Earl Jones\",\"Garrick Hagon\",\"Joe Johnston\",\"Phil Tippett\",\"Shane Rimmer\",\"Angus MacInnes\",\"Jack Purvis\",\"Alex McCrindle\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Gary Kurtz\",\"Rick McCallum\",\"George Lucas\"]},{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"George Lucas\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"George Lucas\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"George Lucas\"]}]\t[\"Lucasfilm\"]\t\t[\"National Film Registry\",\"Academy Award for Best Film Editing\",\"Academy Award for Best Costume Design\",\"Academy Award for Best Production Design\",\"Academy Award for Best Original Score\",\"Academy Award for Best Sound\",\"Academy Award for Best Visual Effects\",\"Special Achievement Academy Award\",\"Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score\",\"BAFTA Award for Best Film Music\",\"Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media\",\"Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film\",\"Saturn Award for Best Director\",\"Saturn Award for Best Writing\",\"Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor\",\"Saturn Award for Best Music\",\"Saturn Award for Best Costume\",\"Saturn Award for Best Make-up\",\"Saturn Award for Best Special Effects\",\"National Board of Review: Top Ten Films\"]\t[\"Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor\",\"Academy Award for Best Director\",\"Academy Award for Best Film Editing\",\"Academy Award for Best Writing, Original Screenplay\",\"Academy Award for Best Costume Design\",\"Academy Award for Best Picture\",\"Academy Award for Best Production Design\",\"Academy Award for Best Original Score\",\"Academy Award for Best Sound\",\"Academy Award for Best Visual Effects\"]\t121\tStar Wars (retroactively titled Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope ) is a 1977 American epic space-opera film written and directed by George Lucas, produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by 20th Century Fox. It stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing, Alec Guinness, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew. It is the first installment of the original Star Wars trilogy, the first of the franchise to be produced, and the fourth episode of the \"Skywalker saga\".  Lucas had the idea for a science-fiction film in the vein of Flash Gordon around the time he completed his first film, THX 1138 (1971) and began working on a treatment after the release of American Graffiti (1973). Star Wars takes place \"a long time ago\", in a fictional universe inhabited by both humans and various alien species; most of the known galaxy is ruled by the tyrannical Galactic Empire, which is only opposed by the Rebel Alliance, a group of freedom fighters. The narrative of the film focuses on the hero journey of Luke Skywalker (Hamill), an everyman who becomes caught in the galactic conflict between the Empire and the Rebellion after coming into possession of two droids, R2-D2 (Baker) and C-3PO (Daniels), who are carrying the schematics of the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star. While attempting to deliver the droids to the Rebellion, Luke is joined by wizened Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Guinness), who teaches him about the metaphysical power known as \"the Force\", cynical smuggler Han Solo (Ford), his Wookiee companion Chewbacca (Mayhew), and Rebellion leader Princess Leia (Fisher). Meanwhile, Imperial officers Darth Vader (Prowse, voiced by Jones), a Sith Lord, and Grand Moff Tarkin (Cushing), the commander of the Death Star, seek to retrieve the stolen schematics and locate the Rebellion's secret base.  After a turbulent production, Star Wars was released in a limited number of theaters in the United States on May 25, 1977, and quickly became a blockbuster hit, leading to it being expanded to a much wider release. The film opened to critical acclaim, most notably for its groundbreaking visual effects. It grossed a total of $775 million (over $550 million during its initial run), surpassing Jaws (1975) to become the highest-grossing film at the time until the release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). When adjusted for inflation, Star Wars is the second-highest-grossing film in North America (behind Gone with the Wind ) and the fourth-highest-grossing film in the world. It received ten Oscar nominations (including Best Picture), winning seven. In 1989, it became one of the first 25 films that was selected by the U.S. Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". At the time, it was the most recent film in the registry and the only one chosen from the 1970s. In 2004, its soundtrack was added to the U.S. National Recording Registry, and was additionally listed by the American Film Institute as the best movie score of all time a year later. Today, it is widely regarded by many in the motion picture industry as one of the greatest and most important films in cinema history.  The film has been reissued multiple times with Lucas's support—most significantly with its 20th-anniversary theatrical \"Special Edition\"—incorporating many changes including modified computer-generated effects, altered dialogue, re-edited shots, remixed soundtracks and added scenes. The film became a pop-cultural phenomenon and launched an industry of tie-in products, including novels, comics, video games, amusement park attractions, and merchandise including toys, games, clothing and many other spin-off works. The film's success led to two critically and commercially successful sequels, The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), and later to a prequel trilogy, a sequel trilogy\n2844\tStarsuckers\t\t0\t\t[\"Documentary\"]\tAUZ6981\t2009\t2009-01-01 00:00:00\t8\t\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Chris Atkins\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t\tStarsuckers is a 2009 British documentary film aiming to expose the \"shams and deceit involved in creating a pernicious celebrity culture\".

Distributed by Troma Entertainment. Filmed in documentary-style, the film follows the character of Gringo, a young man looking for fortune in New York City, only to fall into heroin addiction.  The movie has amassed quite a reputation in certain circles for its depictions of hard drug usage in New York City's East Village area. Many of the cast members, including leading man John Spaceley, are actual junkies. The numerous shooting-up sequences are reportedly entirely real, as are many of the drug dens and their denizens. Perhaps even more notable than the cinema verite structure is the almost total lack of moralizing on the part of the producers or its characters.  Lead actor Spaceley died in the early 1990s, reportedly from AIDS, which he contracted through intravenous drug use. His final moments are chronicled in yet another Lech Kowalski film, \"Born to Lose: The Last Rock & Roll Movie\", a documentary about deceased former New York Dolls guitarist Johnny Thunders.

It is the sixth and final installment in the original Superman film series and serves as an homage sequel to Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980), while ignoring the events of Superman III (1983), Supergirl (1984), and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987). The film stars Brandon Routh as Clark Kent/Superman, Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, with James Marsden, Frank Langella, and Parker Posey. The film tells the story of the title character returning to Earth after a five-year absence. He finds that his love interest Lois Lane has moved on with her life, and that his archenemy Lex Luthor is plotting a scheme to kill Superman and reshape North America.  After a series of unsuccessful projects to resurrect Superman on screen following the critical and financial failure of The Quest for Peace , Warner Bros. Pictures hired Bryan Singer to direct and develop Superman Returns in July 2004. The majority of principal photography took place at Fox Studios Australia, Sydney, while the visual effects sequences were created by a number of studios, including Sony Pictures Imageworks, Rhythm & Hues, Framestore, Rising Sun Pictures, and The Orphanage; filming began in March 2005 and ended in November.  Upon release, the film received generally positive reviews from critics, who complimented its visual effects, story, musical score, and the performances of Routh and Spacey. However, it received criticism focusing on its runtime and lack of action sequences. Despite its critical reception, Warner Bros. was disappointed with the worldwide box office return of the film, cancelling a sequel planned for 2009 as a result. The Superman film series was completely rebooted in 2013 with Man of Steel , directed by Zack Snyder, starring Henry Cavill as Superman, and launching the DC Extended Universe. Routh later reprised his role as Superman in the 2019 Arrowverse crossover \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\".\n2925\tSusan's Plan\t3000000\t4.99\t\t[\"Comedy\"]\tFQA62602\t1998\t1998-01-01 00:00:00\t43\t[\"Nastassja Kinski\",\"Dan Aykroyd\",\"Billy Zane\",\"Michael Biehn\",\"Rob Schneider\",\"Lara Flynn Boyle\",\"Thomas Haden Church\",\"Bill Duke\",\"Lisa Edelstein\",\"Adrian Paul\",\"Stuart Gordon\",\"Carl Ballantine\",\"Joey Travolta\",\"Danny Huston\",\"Sheree North\",\"Jeremy Suarez\",\"Randal Kleiser\",\"Lauren Tom\",\"Adam Rifkin\",\"Robert Harvey\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"John Landis\",\"Brad Wyman\",\"Leslie Belzberg\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"John Landis\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"John Landis\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t85\tSusan's Plan (also released as Dying to Get Rich on video) is a 1998 American black comedy film written and directed by John Landis and starring Nastassja Kinski, Dan Aykroyd, Billy Zane, Rob Schneider, Lara Flynn Boyle and Michael Biehn.

The film was directed by Marc Webb and produced by Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach. It is the fifth theatrical Spider-Man film produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Entertainment, the sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man (2012), and the final film in The Amazing Spider- Man series. The studio hired James Vanderbilt to write the screenplay and Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci to rewrite it. The film stars Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan, Campbell Scott, Embeth Davidtz, Colm Feore, Paul Giamatti, and Sally Field. In the film, Peter Parker tries to have a friendship with Gwen Stacy as he investigates his parents' murder, while also dealing with the supervillain Electro and the return of his childhood friend Harry Osborn, who is dying from a deadly genetic disease.  Development of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 began after the success of The Amazing Spider-Man. DeHaan, Giamatti, Felicity Jones, and Chris Cooper were cast between December 2012 and February 2013. Filming took place in New York City from February to June 2013. The film was released in 2D, 3D, and IMAX 3D on May 2, 2014, in the United States with two international premieres being held between March 31 and April 10 of that year. It received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, with praise for the special effects, chemistry between Stone and Garfield, the action scenes, and Hans Zimmer's musical score, although the script and length received criticism. Foxx's portrayal of Max Dillon / Electro was polarizing. It grossed $709 million worldwide, making it the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2014, but the lowest-grossing live- action Spider-Man film to date.  The Amazing Spider-Man series was originally intended to continue with two sequels and several spin-offs, most notably films centered on Venom and the Sinister Six. Due to The Amazing Spider-Man 2 performing below expectations, all subsequent installments were cancelled and a new iteration of the character, portrayed by Tom Holland in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), began with Captain America: Civil War (2016). The planned spin-offs were re- purposed for a timeline separate from The Amazing Spider-Man continuity and the MCU, beginning with Venom (2018).

It stars Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski, a Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler. He is assaulted as a result of mistaken identity, then learns that a millionaire also named Jeffrey Lebowski was the intended victim. The millionaire Lebowski's trophy wife is kidnapped, and he commissions The Dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release; the plan goes awry when the Dude's friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) schemes to keep the ransom money. Sam Elliott, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, David Huddleston, John Turturro, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, David Thewlis, Peter Stormare, and Ben Gazzara also appear, in supporting roles.  The film is loosely inspired by the work of Raymond Chandler. Joel Coen stated, \"We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story – how it moves episodically, and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that's ultimately unimportant.\" The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen brothers.  The Big Lebowski received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Over time, reviews have become largely positive, and the film has become a cult favorite, noted for its eccentric characters, comedic dream sequences, idiosyncratic dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n3068\tThe Blues Brothers\t30000000\t0\t115200000\t[\"Drama\",\"Musical\",\"Comedy\"]\tNBQ74961\t1980\t1980-06-16 00:00:00\t2288\t[\"John Belushi\",\"Dan Aykroyd\",\"James Brown\",\"Cab Calloway\",\"Rey Charles\",\"Aretha Franklin\",\"Matt Murphy\",\"Steve Cropper\",\"Donald Dunn\",\"Murphy Dunne\",\"Willie Hall\",\"Tom Malone\",\"Lou Marini\",\"Alan Rubin\",\"Carrie Fisher\",\"Henry Gibson\",\"John Candy\",\"Kathleen Freeman\",\"Steve Lawrence\",\"Twiggy Lawson\",\"Jeff Morris\",\"Charles Napier\",\"John Lee Hooker\",\"Frank Oz\",\"John Landis\",\"Steven Spielberg\",\"Joe Walsh\",\"Sheilah Wells\",\"Paul Reubens\",\"Ben Piazza\",\"James Avery\",\"Raven De La Croix\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Bernie Brillstein\",\"George Folsey\",\"Robert K.

It stars John Belushi as \"Joliet\" Jake Blues and Dan Aykroyd as his brother Elwood, characters developed from the recurring musical sketch \"The Blues Brothers\" on NBC variety series Saturday Night Live. The film is set in and around Chicago, Illinois, where it was filmed, and the screenplay was written by Aykroyd and Landis. It features musical numbers by rhythm and blues (R&B), soul, and blues singers James Brown, Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Chaka Khan, and John Lee Hooker. It features non- musical supporting performances by Carrie Fisher, Henry Gibson, Charles Napier and John Candy.  The story is a tale of redemption for paroled convict Jake and his blood brother Elwood, who set out on \"a mission from God\" to save from foreclosure the Catholic orphanage in which they were raised. To do so, they must reunite their R&B band and organize a performance to earn $5,000 needed to pay the orphanage's property tax bill. Along the way, they are targeted by a homicidal \"mystery woman\", Neo-Nazis, and a country and western band—all while being relentlessly pursued by the police.  Universal Studios, which had won the bidding war for the film, was hoping to take advantage of Belushi's popularity in the wake of Saturday Night Live , the film Animal House , and The Blues Brothers' musical success; it soon found itself unable to control production costs. The start of filming was delayed when Aykroyd, who was new to film screenwriting, took six months to deliver a long and unconventional script that Landis had to rewrite before production, which began without a final budget. On location in Chicago, Belushi's partying and drug use caused lengthy and costly delays that, along with the destructive car chases depicted onscreen, made the final film one of the most expensive comedies ever produced.  Due to concerns that the film would fail, its initial bookings were less than half of those similar films normally received. Released in the United States on June 20, 1980, it received mostly positive reviews. It earned just under $5 million in its opening weekend and grossed over $115 million in theaters worldwide before its release on home video. It has become a cult film, spawning the sequel Blues Brothers 2000 (1998), which was a critical and commercial failure.  In 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n3075\tThe Book of Stars\t\t3.99\t\t[\"Family\",\"Drama\"]\tMEO11635\t1999\t1999-01-01 00:00:00\t9\t[\"Mary Stuart Masterson\",\"Jena Malone\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"David Skinner\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Michael Miner\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t111\tThe Book of Stars is a 1999 American drama film directed by Michael Miner and starring Mary Stuart Masterson and Jena Malone as two sisters, both of whom are on the down slopes of their lives but in entirely different ways.

Its plot follows a man and his mentally-ill ex-wife, who has been sequestered by a psychologist known for his controversial therapy techniques. A series of brutal unsolved murders serves as the backdrop for the central narrative.  Conceived by Cronenberg after his own acrimonious divorce, he intended the screenplay as a meditation on a fractured relationship between a husband and wife who share a child, and cast Eggar and Hindle as loose facsimiles of himself and his ex-wife. He would later state that, despite its incorporation of science fiction elements, he considered it his sole feature that most embodied a \"classic horror film\". Principal photography of The Brood took place in late 1978 in Toronto on a budget of $1.5 million. The film's score was composed by Howard Shore, in his film composing debut.  Released in the spring of 1979 by New World Pictures, The Brood proved profitable for the studio, grossing over $5 million. Though it initially received mixed reviews from critics, it would establish itself as a cult film in the following decades. It has attracted scholarly interest from academics in the areas of film theory for its themes regarding mental illness and parenthood. In 2006, the Chicago Film Critics Association named it the 88th scariest film of all time. In 2013, it was selected for restoration by the Criterion Collection, which subsequently released it on Blu-ray.\n3096\tThe Burning\t1500000\t4.99\t707770\t[\"Horror\",\"Thriller\"]\tZKN80141\t1981\t1981-01-01 00:00:00\t279\t[\"Brian Matthews\",\"Leah Ayres\",\"Brian Backer\",\"Jason Alexander\",\"Fisher Stevens\",\"Holly Hunter\",\"Larry Joshua\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Harvey Weinstein\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Tony Maylam\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Peter Lawrence\",\"Bob Weinstein\"]}]\t[\"Miramax\"]\trevenge\t\t\t91\tThe Burning is a 1981 American slasher film directed by Tony Maylam, and starring Brian Matthews, Leah Ayres, Brian Backer, Larry Joshua, and Lou David.

It stars Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, and Milla Jovovich. Primarily set in the 23rd century, the film's central plot involves the survival of planet Earth, which becomes the responsibility of Korben Dallas (Willis), a taxicab driver and former special forces major, after a young woman (Jovovich) falls into his cab. To accomplish this, Dallas joins forces with her to recover four mystical stones essential for the defence of Earth against the impending attack of a malevolent cosmic entity.  Besson started writing the story that became The Fifth Element when he was 16 years old; he was 38 when the film opened in cinemas. Besson wanted to shoot the film in France, but suitable facilities could not be found; filming took place in London and Mauritania, instead. Comics artists Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud and Jean-Claude Mézières, whose books provided inspiration for parts of the film, were hired for production design. Costume design was by Jean-Paul Gaultier.  The Fifth Element received mainly positive reviews, although it tended to polarise critics. The film won in categories at the British Academy Film Awards, the César Awards, the Cannes Film Festival, and the Lumières Awards, but also received nominations at the Golden Raspberry and Stinkers Bad Movie Awards. The Fifth Element was a financial success, earning more than $263 million at the box office on a $90 million budget. At the time of its release, it was the most expensive European film ever made, and remained the highest- grossing French film at the international box office until the release of The Intouchables in 2011.\n3222\tThe Flintstones\t46000000\t3.99\t341600000\t[\"Comedy\",\"Drama\",\"Fantasy\"]\tSMJ12645\t1994\t1994-05-27 00:00:00\t1157\t[\"John Goodman\",\"Rick Moranis\",\"Elizabeth Perkins\",\"Rosie O'Donnell\",\"Kyle MacLachlan\",\"Halle Berry\",\"Elizabeth Taylor\",\"Dann Florek\",\"Harvey Korman\",\"Richard Moll\",\"Sheryl Lee Ralph\",\"Jonathan Winters\",\"Irwin Keyes\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Bruce Cohen\"]},{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"Joseph Barbera\",\"William Hanna\",\"Kathleen Kennedy\",\"David Kirschner\",\"Gerald R.

The B-52's (as The BC-52's in the film) performed their version of the cartoon's theme song.  The film, shot in California, was theatrically released on May 27, 1994, and earned almost $342 million worldwide against a $46 million budget, making it a huge box office success, despite earning negative reviews from critics. Observers criticized the storyline and tone, which they deemed too mature for family audiences, but praised its faithfulness to its source material, visual effects, costume design, art direction, and performances (particularly Goodman's as Fred). A tie-in promotion with McDonald's was made to promote the film. The movie was originally acquired by New Line Cinema, but then sold to Universal Pictures.

While the film primarily spoofs the Star Wars universe in the format of a Crocodile Hunter special, there are several other notable targets, including swipes at Army of Darkness , \"Crocodile\" Dundee , Star Trek , Shaft , The Princess Bride , and Aliens. The film starts with a quick series of faux channel changes, opening with a cameo appearance by Crazy Watto and continuing with Star Wars versions of Cheers and The Six Million Dollar Man.  The film bears the odd credit \"Special Thanks to Peter Mayhew for giving us the inspiration – that's right, blame the Wookiee!\" According to Star Wars Insider , this credit is due to a missed dinner engagement with the Star Wars actor, which led the filmmakers to amuse themselves while waiting for him, eventually hitting upon the idea that became this film. They good- naturedly credit his not appearing at dinner with kick-starting the film.  The film has played at many film festivals, and proven popular with Star Wars fans, winning several awards, including Best Visual Effects at the 2003 Dahlonega International Film Festival, and the Audience Choice Award in the Lucasfilm-sponsored 2003 Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards.

The film's story is centred on two dogs named Rowf and Snitter, who escape from a research laboratory in Great Britain. In the process of telling the story, the film highlights the cruelty of performing vivisection and animal research for its own sake (though Rosen said that this was not an anti- vivisection film, but an adventure), an idea that had only recently come to public attention during the 1960s–70s.\n3475\tThe Professionals\t\t2.99\t19500000\t[\"Western\"]\tSNR99023\t1966\t1966-11-02 00:00:00\t330\t[\"Burt Lancaster\",\"Lee Marvin\",\"Claudia Cardinale\",\"Robert Ryan\",\"Woody Strode\",\"Jack Palance\",\"Ralph Bellamy\",\"Vaughn Taylor\",\"Leigh Chapman\",\"Joe De Santis\",\"Jorge Martínez de Hoyos\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Richard Brooks\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Richard Brooks\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Richard Brooks\",\"Frank O'Rourke\"]}]\t\tMexican Revolution\t\t[\"Academy Award for Best Director\",\"Academy Award for Best Cinematography, Color\",\"Academy Award for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay\"]\t117\tThe Professionals is a 1966 American Western film written, produced, and directed by Richard Brooks and starring Burt Lancaster, Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan, and Claudia Cardinale, with Jack Palance, Ralph Bellamy, and Woody Strode in supporting roles.

The film is an adaptation of the 1959 stage musical of the same name, composed by Richard Rodgers with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. The film's screenplay was written by Ernest Lehman, adapted from the stage musical's book by Lindsay and Crouse. Based on the 1949 memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria von Trapp, the film is about a young Austrian postulant in Salzburg, Austria, in 1938 who is sent to the villa of a retired naval officer and widower to be governess to his seven children. After bringing love and music into the lives of the family, she marries the officer and, together with the children, finds a way to survive the loss of their homeland to the Nazis.  Filming took place from March to September 1964 in Los Angeles and Salzburg. The Sound of Music was released on March 2, 1965, in the United States, initially as a limited roadshow theatrical release. Although initial critical response to the film was mixed, it was a major commercial success, becoming the number one box office movie after four weeks, and the highest-grossing film of 1965. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest- grossing film of all-time—surpassing Gone with the Wind —and held that distinction for five years. The film was just as popular throughout the world, breaking previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries. Following an initial theatrical release that lasted four and a half years, and two successful re-releases, the film sold 283 million admissions worldwide and earned a total worldwide gross of $286 million.  The Sound of Music received five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Wise's second pair of both awards, the first being from the 1961 film West Side Story. The film also received two Golden Globe Awards, for Best Motion Picture and Best Actress, the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement, and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. In 1998, the American Film Institute (AFI) listed The Sound of Music as the fifty-fifth greatest American movie of all time, and the fourth greatest movie musical.

The screenplay was written by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr., and was inspired by an article titled \"Top Guns\" published in California magazine three years earlier. The film stars Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer, Anthony Edwards, and Tom Skerritt. Cruise plays Lieutenant Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, a young naval aviator aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. He and his Radar Intercept Officer, LTJG Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Edwards) are given the chance to train at the US Navy's Fighter Weapons School at Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego, California.  Top Gun was released on May 16, 1986. Upon its release, the film received generally mixed reviews from film critics but many particularly praised the action sequences, the effects, the aerial stunts, and the acting performances with Cruise and McGillis receiving the most praise. Four weeks after release, the number of theaters showing it increased by 45 percent. Despite its initial mixed critical reaction, the film was a huge commercial hit grossing US$356 million against a production budget of only US$15 million. The film maintained its popularity over the years and earned an IMAX 3D re-release in 2013. Additionally, the film won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Take My Breath Away\" performed by Berlin.  In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". A sequel, titled Top Gun: Maverick was originally scheduled for release on June 26, 2020, which was postponed to December 23, 2020, then to November 19, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n3701\tTourist Trap\t350000\t0\t\t[\"Horror\",\"Thriller\"]\tTRP21503\t1979\t1979-01-01 00:00:00\t144\t[\"Chuck Connors\",\"Jocelyn Jones\",\"Tanya Roberts\",\"Albert Band\",\"Linnea Quigley\",\"Arlecchino\"]\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"David Schmoeller\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"David Schmoeller\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t90\tTourist Trap is a 1979 American supernatural slasher film directed by David Schmoeller and starring Chuck Connors, Jocelyn Jones, Jon Van Ness, Robin Sherwood, and Tanya Roberts.

It is the sequel to 2007's Transformers , as well as the second installment in the live-action Transformers film series. Taking place two years after the first film, the story revolves around Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), who is caught once again in the war between the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and the Decepticons, led by Megatron (Hugo Weaving). Sam begins having strange visions of Cybertronian symbols, and is being hunted by the Decepticons under the orders of an ancient Decepticon named The Fallen, who seeks to get revenge on Earth by finding and activating a machine that would provide the Decepticons with an energon source, destroying the Sun and all life on Earth in the process. Returning Transformers include Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, Megatron, Starscream, and Scorponok.  With deadlines jeopardized by possible strikes by the Directors Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild, Bay managed to finish the production on time with the help of previsualization and a scriptment by his writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and series newcomer Ehren Kruger. Shooting took place between May and September 2008, with locations in Egypt, Jordan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and California, as well as air bases in New Mexico and Arizona. It is the last film in the series to star Megan Fox, and is also the last film in the series to be co-produced by DreamWorks Pictures, leaving Paramount Pictures as the sole distributor of its future sequels, starting with Dark of the Moon.  Revenge of the Fallen premiered on June 8, 2009 in Tokyo and was released on June 24, 2009 in the United States. Critical reception was negative, with critics considering it to be inferior to the first film. Critics panned the film's plot, script, crude humor, characters, and runtime, while praising the visual effects, action scenes, score, and the performances of Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving. The film won three Golden Raspberry Awards at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony and became the highest-grossing film to win the Worst Picture award. The film surpassed its predecessor at the box office, grossing a total of $402.1 million in the US and Canada and $434.2 million in other territories, for a total of $836.3 million worldwide, making it the 37th highest-grossing domestic film and fourth-highest of the year worldwide. With over 11 million home media sales in 2009, it was also the top-selling film of the year in the United States.

It was viewed over 150 million times on Tencent within three days of its release, and had been viewed a further 150 million times by the time it was taken offline four days later.  Chai Jing started making the documentary when her as yet unborn daughter developed a tumor in the womb, which had to be removed very soon after her birth. Chai blames China's air pollution for the tumor. The film, which combines footage of a lecture with interviews and factory visits, has been compared with Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth in both its style and potential impact. The film openly criticizes state-owned energy companies, steel producers and coal factories, as well as showing the inability of the Ministry of Environmental Protection to act against the big polluters.  Despite demonstrating the failure of China's regulations on pollution, the Chinese government at first did not censor the film. Instead, the People's Daily reposted the film alongside an interview with Chai, while Chen Jining, the recently appointed minister for environmental protection, praised the film, expressing in a text message his gratitude. However, within a week, the Communist Party’s publicity department confidentially ordered the film to be removed. An employee of China Business News was suspended for leaking the order.\n3774\tUnicorn Store\t\t4.99\t\t[\"Comedy\"]\tMNB84300\t2017\t2017-09-11 00:00:00\t206\t[\"Brie Larson\",\"Joan Cusack\",\"Samuel L.

The film centers on an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) and an earnest boy named Russell (Jordan Nagai); by tying thousands of balloons to his house, Carl sets out to fulfill his dream to see the wilds of South America and complete a promise made to his late wife, Ellie. The film was directed by Pete Docter and co-directed by Bob Peterson, who also wrote the film's screenplay with Docter, as well as the story with Tom McCarthy. The music was composed by Michael Giacchino, who had also composed music for The Incredibles and Ratatouille.  Docter began working on the story in 2004 called Heliums , which was based on fantasies of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela gathering research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth. It was Pixar's first film to be presented in Disney Digital 3-D.   Up was released on May 29, 2009, and opened the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, becoming the first animated and 3-D film to do so. The film grossed over $735 million, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 2009. The film received widespread acclaim from critics and audiences, with many calling it one of the best animated films of all time. The characters, themes, narrative, Asner's vocal performance and Giacchino's score were praised, as was the montage of Carl and his wife Ellie growing old together. The film won two Academy Awards, including Best Animated Feature, and was nominated for three more, including Best Picture, making it the second animated film in history to receive such a nomination (and the first Pixar film to do so), following Beauty and the Beast (1991).\n3790\tV/H/S/2\t\t1.99\t805574\t[\"Horror\",\"Thriller\",\"History\"]\tNZL42828\t2013\t2013-01-19 00:00:00\t395\t[\"Adam Wingard\",\"Mindy Robinson\",\"Oka Antara\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Kimo Stamboel\"]},{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"Simon Barrett\",\"Adam Wingard\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Adam Wingard\",\"Eduardo Sánchez\",\"Gregg Hale\",\"Gareth Evans\",\"Jason Eisener\",\"Timo Tjahjanto\",\"Simon Barrett\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Eduardo Sánchez\",\"Jason Eisener\",\"Timo Tjahjanto\",\"Simon Barrett\",\"Gareth Evans\"]}]\t[\"Bloody Disgusting\"]\t\t\t\t96\tV/H/S/2 (originally titled S-VHS ) is a 2013 horror anthology film produced by Bloody Disgusting.

(Spanish: ¿Qué he hecho yo para merecer esto! ) is a 1984 Spanish black comedy written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar. The title is sometimes given with an exclamation mark at the end rather than a question mark.  Starring Carmen Maura, Ángel de Andrés López, Chus Lampreave and Verónica Forqué, the films follows the misadventures of an overworked housewife and her dysfunctional family. What Have I Done , Almodovar's fourth film, became the first of his works to be released theatrically in the U.S. premiering to sold- out crowds as part of New Directors/New Films series, co-sponsored by the New York Film Festival and the Film Department of the Museum of Modern Art.  Almodóvar has described What Have I Done as a homage to Italian neorealism, although this tribute also involves jokes about paedophilia, prostitution, and a telekinetic child. The film, set in the tower blocks around Madrid, depicts female frustration and family breakdown, echoing Jean-Luc Godard's Two or Three Things I Know About Her and strong story plots from Roald Dahl's Lamb to the Slaughter and Truman Capote's \"A Day's Work\" but with Almodóvar's unique approach to filmmaking. Technically, What Have I Done? is deliberately crude and the production values raw, a combined result of the film's low-budget as well as Almodovar's relative lack of experience. But the film's shabby look is in tune with the tale's squalid realistic context and social class of its protagonists.  What Have I Done? was critically much better received than Almodovar's three previous films and put him on the movie map in America as a major talent to watch.\n3880\tWhat the Swedish Butler Saw\t\t4.99\t\t[\"Drama\",\"Comedy\"]\tVGQ61200\t1975\t1975-01-01 00:00:00\t15\t[\"Ole Søltoft\",\"Sue Longhurst\",\"Martin Ljung\",\"Diana Dors\",\"Per-Axel Arosenius\",\"Barbro Hiort af Ornäs\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Inge Ivarson\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Vernon P.

The plot centers on a group of popular high schoolers who invite an attractive outsider, Mandy Lane, to spend the weekend at a secluded ranch house, where they are followed by a merciless killer.  Originally completed in 2006, the film premiered at a number of film festivals throughout 2006 and 2007, including the Toronto International Film Festival, Sitges Film Festival, South by Southwest, and London FrightFest Film Festival. It received a theatrical release in the United Kingdom on February 15, 2008. All the Boys Love Mandy Lane received mixed reviews from critics, with some dismissing the film as \"bogus and compromised\", and others praising its \"grindhouse\" aesthetic and likening its cinematography to the early work of Terrence Malick and Tobe Hooper.  Despite its international attention, the film remained unreleased in the United States for over seven years after it was completed; this was due to complications with its distributor, Senator Entertainment, which went bankrupt shortly after purchasing the film from The Weinstein Company. On March 8, 2013, it was announced that The Weinstein Company had re-acquired the rights to theatrically release the film in the United States.

Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, an advertising executive who has a midlife crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, played by Mena Suvari. Annette Bening stars as Lester's materialistic wife, Carolyn, and Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter, Jane. Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, and Allison Janney also feature. Academics have described the film as a satire of American middle class notions of beauty and personal satisfaction; further analysis has focused on the film's explorations of romantic and paternal love, sexuality, materialism, self-liberation, and redemption.  Ball began writing American Beauty as a play in the early 1990s, partly inspired by the media circus that accompanied the Amy Fisher trial in 1992. He shelved the play after deciding that the story would not work on stage. After several years as a television screenwriter, Ball revived the idea in 1997 when attempting to break into the film industry. The rewritten script had a cynical outlook influenced by Ball's frustrating tenures writing for several sitcoms. Producers Dan Jinks and Bruce Cohen took the script for American Beauty to the fledgling DreamWorks studio, which bought it for $250,000, outbidding several other production bodies. DreamWorks financed the $15-million production and served as its North American distributor. American Beauty marked acclaimed theater director Mendes' film debut; courted after his successful productions of the musicals Oliver! and Cabaret , Mendes was nevertheless only given the job after twenty others were considered and several A-list directors reportedly turned down the opportunity.  Spacey was Mendes' first choice for the role of Lester, though DreamWorks urged him to consider better-known actors. Similarly, the studio suggested several actresses for the role of Carolyn until Mendes offered the part to Bening without the studio's knowledge. Principal photography took place between December 1998 and February 1999 on sound stages at the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, California and on location in Los Angeles. Mendes' dominant directorial style was deliberate and composed; he made extensive use of static shots and slow pans and zooms to generate tension. Cinematographer Conrad Hall complemented Mendes' style with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events. During editing, Mendes made several changes that softened the cynical tone of Ball's script.  Released in North America on September 17, 1999, American Beauty received widespread critical and popular acclaim; it was the best-reviewed American film of the year and grossed over $350 million worldwide against its $15-million budget. Reviewers praised most aspects of the production, with particular emphasis on Mendes, Spacey and Ball; criticism tended to focus on the familiarity of the characters and setting. DreamWorks launched a major campaign to increase American Beauty 's chances of Oscar success following its controversial Best Picture snubs for Saving Private Ryan (1998) the previous year. At the Oscars, the film won Best Picture, along with Best Director for Mendes, Best Actor for Spacey, Best Original Screenplay for Ball and Best Cinematography for Hall. The film was nominated for and won many other awards and honors, mainly for directing, writing and acting.\n246\tAmerican Hero\t1000000\t4.99\t26000000\t[\"Comedy\",\"Sci-Fi\"]\tODS88087\t2015\t2015-12-11 00:00:00\t98\t[\"Stephen Dorff\",\"Eddie Griffin\"]\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Nick Love\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Nick Love\"]}]\t[\"Vertigo Films\"]\t\t\t\t86\tAmerican Hero is a 2015 American-British superhero comedy-drama film written and directed by Nick Love.

Austin Stoker stars as a police officer who defends a defunct precinct against a relentless criminal gang, along with Darwin Joston as a convicted murderer who helps him. Laurie Zimmer, Tony Burton, Martin West, and Nancy Kyes co-star as other defenders of the precinct.  Carpenter was approached by producer J. Stein Kaplan to make a low-budget exploitation film for under $100,000, on the condition that Carpenter would have total creative control. Carpenter's script, originally titled The Anderson Alamo , was inspired by the Howard Hawks Western film Rio Bravo and the George A. Romero horror film Night of the Living Dead. Despite controversy with the MPAA over a scene involving the violent killing of a young girl, the film received an R rating and opened in the United States on November 5, 1976.  The film was initially met with mixed reviews and unimpressive box-office returns in the United States, but when the film premiered in the 1977 London Film Festival, it received an ecstatic review by festival director Ken Wlaschin that led to critical acclaim first in Britain and then throughout Europe. It has garnered a cult following and reappraisal from critics, with many evaluating the film as one of the best action films of its era and of Carpenter's career. A remake was released in 2005, directed by Jean-François Richet and starring Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburne.\n356\tAt the Edge of Conquest: The Journey of Chief Wai-Wai\t\t4.99\t\t[\"Documentary\"]\tBMV53449\t1992\t1992-01-01 00:00:00\t1\t\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Geoffrey O'Connor\"]}]\t\t\t\t[\"Academy Award for Best Documentary\"]\t\tAt the Edge of Conquest: The Journey of Chief Wai-Wai is a 1992 American-Canadian short documentary film directed by Geoffrey O'Connor.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to The Avengers (2012) and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and the 19th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Josh Brolin, and Chris Pratt. In the film, the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy attempt to prevent Thanos from collecting the six all-powerful Infinity Stones as part of his quest to kill half of all life in the universe.  The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1. The Russo brothers came on board to direct in April 2015, and a month later Markus and McFeely had signed on to write the script for the film, which draws inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 comic book The Infinity Gauntlet and Jonathan Hickman's 2013 comic book Infinity. In 2016, Marvel shortened the title to Avengers: Infinity War. Filming began in January 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with a large cast consisting mostly of actors reprising their roles from previous MCU films, including Brolin as Thanos. The production lasted until July 2017, shooting back-to-back with a direct sequel, Avengers: Endgame (2019). Additional filming took place in Scotland, the Downtown Atlanta area, and New York City. With an estimated budget of $325–400 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.  Avengers: Infinity War premiered in Los Angeles on April 23, 2018, and was released in the United States on April 27, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for Brolin's performance, visual effects, action sequences, and emotional weight, but was criticized for relying on previous MCU films for its story. The film was the fourth film and the first superhero film to gross over $2 billion worldwide, breaking numerous box office records, and becoming the highest-grossing film of 2018 and the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time both worldwide and in the United States and Canada. The film's visual effects were nominated at the 91st Academy Awards, 24th Critics' Choice Awards, and 72nd British Academy Film Awards.

Written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale, it stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas F. Wilson. Set in 1985, the story follows Marty McFly (Fox), a teenager accidentally sent back to 1955 in a time-traveling DeLorean automobile built by his eccentric scientist friend Doctor Emmett \"Doc\" Brown (Lloyd). Trapped in the past, Marty inadvertently prevents his future parents' meeting—threatening his very existence—and is forced to reconcile the pair and somehow get back to the future.  Back to the Future was conceived of in 1980, by Gale and Zemeckis. They were desperate for a successful film after numerous collaborative failures, but their idea was rejected over 40 times by studios because it was not considered raunchy enough to compete with the successful comedies of the era. A development deal was secured following Zemeckis' success directing Romancing the Stone (1984). Fox was the first choice to portray Marty, but he was unavailable; Eric Stoltz was cast instead. Shortly after principal photography began in November 1984, Zemeckis determined Stoltz was not right for the part and made the concessions necessary to hire Fox. This included re-filming scenes already shot with Stoltz and adding $4 million to the budget. Back to the Future was filmed in and around California and on sets at Universal Studios. Filming concluded the following April.  Replacing Stoltz delayed production and the film's release date but, following highly successful test screenings, the date was brought forward to July 3, 1985, to give Back to the Future more time in theaters. This resulted in a rushed post-production schedule, and some incomplete special effects. Back to the Future was a critical and commercial success, earning $381.1 million to become the highest-grossing film of 1985 worldwide. Critics praised the story, comedy, and the cast—particularly Fox, Lloyd, Thompson, and Glover. It received multiple award nominations and won an Academy Award, Saturn Awards, and a Hugo Award. Its theme song, \"The Power of Love\" by Huey Lewis and the News was a significant success globally.  In the years since its release, Back to the Future has grown in esteem and is now considered to be among the greatest films of the 1980s, one of the best science-fiction films ever made, and one of the greatest films of all time. In 2007, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry. The film was followed by two sequels, Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990). With its effect on popular culture and a dedicated fan following, Back to the Future launched a multimedia franchise. This includes an animated television series, video games, comic books, board games, clothing, music, books, food, toys, collectibles, and theme park rides. Its enduring popularity has led to numerous books about its production, documentaries, and commercials. Back to the Future has been adapted into a 2020 stage musical.\n399\tBad Day on the Block\t\t0\t\t[\"Thriller\"]\tRBL91270\t1996\t1996-01-01 00:00:00\t15\t[\"Charlie Sheen\",\"Mare Winningham\",\"David Andrews\",\"Noah Fleiss\",\"John Ratzenberger\",\"David Hewlett\",\"Sandra Oh\",\"Kim Roberts\",\"David Sutcliffe\",\"Dawnn Lewis\"]\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Craig R.

Based on the fairy tale of the same name by Charles Perrault, it is the twelfth Disney animated feature film. The film was directed by Clyde Geronimi, Hamilton Luske, and Wilfred Jackson. Mack David, Jerry Livingston, and Al Hoffman wrote the songs, which include \"Cinderella\", \"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes\", \"Oh, Sing Sweet Nightingale\", \"The Work Song\", \"Bibbidi- Bobbidi-Boo\", and \"So This is Love\". It features the voices of Ilene Woods, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton, Rhoda Williams, James MacDonald, Luis van Rooten, Don Barclay, Mike Douglas, William Phipps, and Lucille Bliss.  During the early 1940s, Walt Disney Productions had suffered financially after losing connections to the European film markets due to the outbreak of World War II. Because of this, the studio endured box office bombs such as Pinocchio (1940), Fantasia (1940), and Bambi (1942), all of which would later become more successful with several re-releases in theaters and on home video. By 1947, the studio was over $4 million in debt and was on the verge of bankruptcy. Walt Disney and his animators returned to feature film production in 1948 after producing a string of package films with the idea of adapting Charles Perrault's Cendrillon into an animated film.  After two years in production, Cinderella was released by RKO Radio Pictures on February 15, 1950. It became the greatest critical and commercial hit for the Disney studio since the first full-length animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and helped reverse the studio's fortunes. It received three Academy Award nominations, including Best Music, Original Song for \"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo\".  Decades later, it was followed by two direct-to-video sequels, Cinderella II: Dreams Come True (2002) and Cinderella III: A Twist in Time (2007), and a 2015 live-action adaptation directed by Kenneth Branagh. The castle featured in the film has become an icon of The Walt Disney Company, serving as a basis for the production logo of Walt Disney Pictures. A real life construction of the castle was built at the Magic Kingdom park at Walt Disney World, as well at Tokyo Disneyland.  In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n740\tCity by the Sea\t40000000\t4.99\t29413966\t[\"Crime\",\"Film-Noir\",\"Drama\",\"Mystery\"]\tWXK63144\t2002\t2002-09-06 00:00:00\t99\t[\"Robert De Niro\",\"James Franco\",\"Eliza Dushku\",\"William Forsythe\",\"Frances McDormand\",\"George Dzundza\",\"Patti LuPone\",\"Anson Mount\",\"Brian Tarantina\",\"John Doman\",\"Drena De Niro\",\"Leo Burmester\",\"Nestor Serrano\",\"Linda Emond\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Michael Caton-Jones\",\"Elie Samaha\",\"Don Carmody\",\"Andrew Stevens\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Michael Caton-Jones\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Ken Hixon\"]}]\t[\"Warner Bros.\"]\t\t\t\t104\tCity by the Sea is a 2002 American crime drama film starring Robert De Niro, James Franco, Eliza Dushku, Frances McDormand and William Forsythe.

It co-stars Richard Crenna as Rambo's mentor Sam Trautman and Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Teasle, and is the first installment in the Rambo franchise, followed by Rambo: First Blood Part II.  The film is based on the 1972 novel of the same name by David Morrell, which many directors and studios had unsuccessfully attempted to adapt in the 1970s. In the film, Rambo, a troubled and misunderstood Vietnam veteran, must rely on his combat and survival skills when a series of brutal events results in him having to survive a massive manhunt by police and government troops near the small town of Hope, Washington.  First Blood was released in the United States on October 22, 1982. Despite initial mixed reviews, the film was a box office success, grossing $156 million at the box office. In 1985, it also became the first Hollywood blockbuster to be released in China, holding the record for the largest number of tickets sold for an American film until 2018. Since its release, First Blood has been reappraised by critics, with many highlighting the roles of Stallone, Dennehy, and Crenna, and recognizing it as an influential film in the action genre.  The film's success spawned a franchise, consisting of four sequels (all of which were co-written by and starred Stallone), an animated television series and a series of comic books, novels, video games, as well as a Bollywood remake.\n1193\tFlashdance\t7000000\t0\t201500000\t[\"Romance\",\"Musical\",\"Drama\"]\tIOI58759\t1983\t1983-04-15 00:00:00\t1194\t[\"Jennifer Beals\",\"Michael Nouri\",\"Lilia Skala\",\"Belinda Bauer\",\"Cynthia Rhodes\",\"Lucy Lee Flippin\",\"Malcolm Danare\",\"Monique Gabrielle\",\"Norman Scott\",\"Phil Bruns\",\"Robert Wuhl\",\"Sunny Johnson\",\"B-Boys\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Don Simpson\",\"Jerry Bruckheimer\",\"Lynda Obst\",\"Peter Guber\",\"Jon Peters\"]},{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"Jerry Bruckheimer\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Adrian Lyne\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Thomas Hedley\",\"Joe Eszterhas\"]}]\t[\"PolyGram Filmed Entertainment\",\"Don Simpson\"]\t\t\t[\"Academy Award for Best Cinematography\",\"Academy Award for Best Film Editing\",\"Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screenplay\"]\t95\tFlashdance is a 1983 American romantic drama dance film directed by Adrian Lyne and starring Jennifer Beals as a passionate young dancer who aspires to become a professional ballerina (Alex), alongside Michael Nouri playing her boyfriend and the owner of the steel mill where she works by day in Pittsburgh. It was the first collaboration of producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, and the presentation of some sequences in the style of music videos was an influence on other 1980s films including Footloose , Purple Rain , and Top Gun , Simpson and Bruckheimer's most famous production. It was also one of Lyne's first major film releases, building on a television commercials. Alex's elaborate dance sequences were shot using body doubles (Beals' main double was the uncredited French actress Marine Jahan, while a breakdance move was doubled by the male dancer Crazy Legs).  The film opened to negative reviews by professional critics, including Roger Ebert, who panned it as \"great sound and flashdance, signifying nothing\" (and eventually placed it on his \"most hated\" list). It was a surprise box-office success, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 1983 in the United States. Its worldwide box-office gross exceeded $200 million. The soundtrack, compiled by Giorgio Moroder, spawned several hit songs, including \"Maniac\" (performed by Michael Sembello), and the Academy Award–winning \"Flashdance... What a Feeling\", which was written for the film by Moroder, with lyrics by Keith Forsey and the singer Irene Cara. Flashdance is also often remembered for its film poster featuring Beals sporting a sweatshirt with a large neck hole (according to the actress, her look in the scene came about by accident after she simply cut a large hole at the top of one that had shrunk in the wash).\n1201\tFlywheel\t20000\t4.99\t37000\t[\"Drama\"]\tXUM57024\t2003\t2003-01-01 00:00:00\t47\t\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Alex Kendrick\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Alex Kendrick\"]}]\t[\"Sherwood Pictures\"]\t\t\t\t120\tFlywheel is a 2003 American Christian drama film about the unexpected pitfalls that a used car dealer experienced as he suddenly goes honest.

It stars Bill Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis as Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler, a trio of eccentric parapsychologists who start a ghost-catching business in New York City. The film also stars Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis, and features Annie Potts, William Atherton, and Ernie Hudson in supporting roles.  Based on his own fascination with spirituality, Aykroyd conceived Ghostbusters as a project for himself and John Belushi. The protagonists would travel through time and space to combat a host of demonic and supernatural threats. Following Belushi's death, and with Aykroyd's concept deemed financially impractical, he was paired with Ramis to rewrite the script to set it in New York City and make it more realistic. Ghostbusters was the first comedy film to employ expensive special effects. There was concern about the budget it would require and little faith in its potential for box office success. On an approximate $25–30 million budget, filming took place between October 1983 to January 1984, in New York City and Los Angeles, and on sets at Burbank Studios, Los Angeles. Competition for special effects studios among various movies in development at the time meant part of the budget was used to co-found a new studio under Richard Edlund. He used a combination of practical effects, miniatures, and puppets to deliver the ghoulish visuals.  Ghostbusters was released on June 8, 1984, to critical acclaim and became a cultural phenomenon. It was well-received for its blend of comedy, action, and horror, and Murray's performance was often singled out for praise. The film earned $282.2 million during its initial theatrical run, making it the second- highest-grossing film of that year, and the then-highest-grossing comedy in history. It was the number-one film in theaters for seven consecutive weeks and was one of only four films to gross more than $100 million that year. Further theatrical releases have increased the total gross to approximately $295.2 million, making it one of the most successful comedy films of the 1980s. In 2015, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. Its theme song, \"Ghostbusters\" by Ray Parker Jr., was also a number-one hit.  With its effect on popular culture, and a dedicated fan following, the success of Ghostbusters launched a multi-billion dollar multimedia franchise. This included the popular animated television series The Real Ghostbusters (which itself spawned a media franchise), its sequel series Extreme Ghostbusters , video games, board games, comic books, clothing, music, books, food, toys, collectibles, and haunted attractions. Ghostbusters was followed in 1989 by a sequel, Ghostbusters II , which fared less well financially and critically. Repeated attempts to develop a further sequel ended following Ramis's death in 2014. A 2016 reboot, also called Ghostbusters , was released to mixed reviews and financial failure. A second sequel, Ghostbusters: Afterlife , is scheduled for release in 2021.\n1303\tGimme the Loot\t\t3.99\t104235\t[\"Comedy\"]\tBPT40687\t2012\t2012-03-10 00:00:00\t13\t\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Adam Leon\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Adam Leon\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t79\tGimme the Loot is a 2012 American comedy film written and directed by Adam Leon.

The film depicts two days in the lives of four real estate salesmen and how desperate they become when the corporate office sends a trainer to \"motivate\" them. He tells them that, in a week's time, all except the top two salesmen will be fired.  The setting of the film is never explicitly stated. While the play is set in Chicago, Illinois, the film includes numerous references to New York City, including an establishing shot of a New York City Subway platform followed by a close-up shot of a New York Telephone-branded payphone, NYPD police cars and insignia, New York license plates, most characters using New York accents, etc. Film critics and journalists have nonetheless cited Chicago as the setting of the film, possibly based on their familiarity with the original play. Exterior shots were filmed on location in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn.  Like the play, the film is notorious for its use of profanity, leading the cast to refer to the film jokingly as \"Death of a Fuckin' Salesman\". The title of the film comes from the names of two of the real estate developments being peddled by the salesmen characters: Glengarry Highlands and Glen Ross Farms.  The world premiere of the film was held at the 49th Venice Film Festival, where Jack Lemmon was awarded the Volpi Cup for Best Actor. Al Pacino was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Though the film was a box office failure, grossing $10.7 million in North America against a $12.5 million budget, Glengarry Glen Ross was acclaimed by critics and is now considered a cult classic.\n1318\tGod's Own Country\t1000000\t3.99\t2600000\t[\"Drama\"]\tWNI2259\t2017\t2017-09-01 00:00:00\t592\t[\"Josh O'Connor\",\"Alec Secăreanu\",\"Gemma Jones\",\"Ian Hart\"]\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Francis Lee\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Francis Lee\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t104\tGod's Own Country is a 2017 British romantic drama film written and directed by Francis Lee in his feature directorial debut.

Gravity was produced entirely in the United Kingdom, where British visual effects company Framestore spent more than three years creating most of the film's visual effects, which involve over 80 of its 91 minutes.  Gravity opened the 70th Venice International Film Festival on August 28, 2013, and had its North American premiere three days later at the Telluride Film Festival. Upon its release, Gravity was met with widespread critical acclaim, with praise for its direction and visuals. Considered one of the best films of 2013, it appeared on numerous critics' year-end lists, and was selected by the American Film Institute in their annual Movies of the Year list. The film became the eighth highest-grossing film of 2013 with a worldwide gross of over $723 million, against a production budget of around $100 million.  The film earned accolades from numerous critics and guilds. At the 86th Academy Awards, Gravity received ten nominations, including Best Actress for Bullock and Best Picture, and won seven awards, including Best Director, Best Original Score, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects.

It draws on legends of folkloric mischievous creatures that causes malfunctions—\"gremlins\"—in the British Royal Air Force going back to World War II and stars Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates, with Howie Mandel providing the voice of Gizmo, the main mogwai character. The story follows a young man who receives a strange creature as a pet, which then spawns other creatures who transform into small, destructive, aggressive monsters that all wreak havoc on a whole town on Christmas Eve.  The film was the center of large merchandising campaigns and opts for black comedy, balanced against a Christmas time setting. Steven Spielberg was the film's executive producer, with the film being produced by Michael Finnell.  Gremlins was theatrically released on June 8, 1984 by Warner Bros. to both critical and commercial success. However, it was heavily criticized for some of its more violent sequences. In response to this and to similar complaints about Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom , Spielberg suggested that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) alter its rating system, which it did within two months of the film's release, creating a new PG-13 rating. It was followed by a sequel, Gremlins 2: The New Batch , which uses a more satirical tone and parodies Hollywood sequels, while a third film, Gremlins 3 , is in active development.\n1367\tGrow Up, Tony Phillips\t\t3.99\t\t[\"Comedy\",\"Family\"]\tAZI24072\t2013\t2013-03-12 00:00:00\t4\t\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Emily Hagins\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Emily Hagins\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t90\tGrow Up, Tony Phillips is a 2013 comedy film by American director Emily Hagins and her fourth feature film.

Molen. It is the first installment in the Jurassic Park franchise, and the first film in the Jurassic Park trilogy, and is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton and a screenplay written by Crichton and David Koepp. The film is set on the fictional island of Isla Nublar, located off Central America's Pacific Coast near Costa Rica. There, wealthy businessman John Hammond and a team of genetic scientists have created a wildlife park of de- extinct dinosaurs. When industrial sabotage leads to a catastrophic shutdown of the park's power facilities and security precautions, a small group of visitors and Hammond's grandchildren struggle to survive and escape the perilous island.  Before Crichton's novel was published, four studios put in bids for its film rights. With the backing of Universal Studios, Spielberg acquired the rights for $1.5 million before its publication in 1990; Crichton was hired for an additional $500,000 to adapt the novel for the screen. Koepp wrote the final draft, which left out much of the novel's exposition and violence and made numerous changes to the characters.  Filming took place in California and Hawaii from August to November 1992, and post-production rolled until May 1993, supervised by Spielberg in Poland as he filmed Schindler's List. The dinosaurs were created with groundbreaking computer-generated imagery by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and with life- sized animatronic dinosaurs built by Stan Winston's team. To showcase the film's sound design, which included a mixture of various animal noises for the dinosaur roars, Spielberg invested in the creation of DTS, a company specializing in digital surround sound formats. The film also underwent an extensive $65 million marketing campaign, which included licensing deals with over 100 companies.  Jurassic Park premiered on June 9, 1993, at the Uptown Theater in Washington, D.C., and was released on June 11 in the United States. It went on to gross over $912 million worldwide in its original theatrical run, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1993 and the highest-grossing film ever at the time, a record held until the release of Titanic in 1997. It received highly positive reviews from critics, who praised its special effects, acting, John Williams' musical score, and Spielberg's direction. Following its 3D re- release in 2013 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, Jurassic Park became the seventeenth and oldest film in history to surpass $1 billion in ticket sales. The film won more than twenty awards, including three Academy Awards for its technical achievements in visual effects and sound design. Jurassic Park is considered a landmark in the development of computer-generated imagery and animatronic visual effects. The film was followed by four commercially successful sequels: The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), Jurassic Park III (2001), Jurassic World (2015), and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), with a fifth sequel, Jurassic World: Dominion , scheduled for a 2022 release.

The film also features acting roles by real-life punk musicians including Steve Jones and Paul Cook of the Sex Pistols, Paul Simonon from the Clash, and Vince Welnick and Fee Waybill from the Tubes.  The Stains are depicted suffering the derision of male audiences and peers, but their dedication—and the fiery public persona of lead singer Corinne Burns—gains them a strong female fan base that ultimately eclipses their antagonists. The last scene is a triumphant MTV-style professional music video, which indicates the band finally achieved rock stardom.  Director Lou Adler and screenwriter Nancy Dowd (aided by Caroline Coon) disagreed starkly on the film's finale, and it was put on hold for two years until it was capped by Adler with the music video. Although it failed to make any commercial headway with its initial release in late 1982, the film became a cult favorite on 1980s cable television, particularly the late-night series Night Flight. Its reputation grew, and it is considered an influence on the feminist riot grrl movement.

It was entered into the 24th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Silver Bear.  The film is based on the stage play Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs by David Halliwell. The full name of the play is used as the film title on the BFI Flipside 2011 DVD release.  An Apple Films project, Little Malcolm was the first feature film produced by former Beatle George Harrison. The film was shot primarily in Lancashire, in the north of England, during February and March 1973. Harrison supplied incidental music for the soundtrack and, after being introduced to the duo Splinter by their manager Mal Evans, produced their song \"Lonely Man\" for inclusion in a pivotal scene.  Like many of Apple's film and recording projects, production on Little Malcolm was then jeopardised by lawsuits pertaining to Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo Starr's severing of ties with manager Allen Klein. Speaking in 2011, Cooper said that Harrison \"fought for a very long time to extract Little Malcolm from the official receivers\", adding that its entry in the Berlin festival was only possible because the festival was an artistic forum and not finance-related. After what Cooper described as an \"incredible\" reception at Berlin for \"this very British film\", Little Malcolm went on to win a gold medal at the Atlanta Film Festival in August 1974.  Once the Beatles' partnership had been formally dissolved, in January 1975, the film received a brief run in London's West End. In February 1983, Harrison donated his personal copy of Little Malcolm to a New York-based company for screening at a local film festival.\n1877\tLittle Things\t\t2.99\t\t[\"Unknown\"]\tSVZ6159\t2014\t2014-01-01 00:00:00\t12\t\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Rati Tsiteladze\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t15\tLittle Things is a 2014 drama short film directed by Rati Tsiteladze and written by Nino Varsimashvili.\n1887\tLocal Hero\t3000000\t0\t5900000\t[\"Comedy\"]\tSDC75894\t1983\t1983-12-02 00:00:00\t415\t[\"Peter Riegert\",\"Burt Lancaster\",\"Denis Lawson\",\"Fulton Mackay\",\"Peter Capaldi\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"David Puttnam\",\"Iain Smith\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Bill Forsyth\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Bill Forsyth\"]}]\t[\"Goldcrest Films\"]\t\t\t\t111\tLocal Hero is a 1983 Scottish comedy-drama film written and directed by Bill Forsyth and starring Peter Riegert, Denis Lawson, Fulton Mackay and Burt Lancaster.

Officially selected by Toronto, Rotterdam, Pusan and several other international film festivals, this art-house debut film explores the contemporary Tehran and its underground art scene, focusing on the life of a young actress who has been banned from her theater work. Struggling to pursue her passion in art as well as her secret lifestyle in a socially oppressed environment, Marzieh gets involved in some subsequent and unexpected events leading her to a decision-making dilemma regarding her survival and identity. My Tehran for Sale has been compared with Cristian Mungiu's film 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days by Parviz Jahed, an Iranian critic and film scholar.  My Tehran For Sale is the winner of Independent Spirit Inside Film Awards 2009. It won the jury award for best feature Film at the TriMedia Film Festival in 2010. Apart from various festivals and universities the film was screened at Museum of Modern Art in New York as well as Cinémathèque Française in Paris.  Unlike already acclaimed Iranian exotic cinema which is mostly known in the West by its portrayal of rural life, nature landscapes, as well as socioeconomically deprived children struggling for survival in the outskirts of Tehran, the writer/director of My Tehran for Sale attempts to depict the middle-class people and the uncertainties in their every day urban life. The film addresses issues such as double life of young people, oppression of women, HIV, secret abortions, underground art, massive emigration, crisis of identity, people smuggling, and asylum seeker detention centres.  Some underground music are employed throughout the film presenting a number of emerging alternative singers such as Mohsen Namjoo.

Directed by Clyde Geronimi, Hamilton Luske, and Wolfgang Reitherman, it was Disney's 17th animated feature film. The film tells the story of a litter of Dalmatian puppies who are kidnapped by the villainous Cruella de Vil (\"deVille\"), who wants to make their fur into coats. Their parents, Pongo and Perdita, set out to save their children from Cruella in the process of rescuing 84 additional puppies that were bought in pet shops, bringing the total of Dalmatians to 101.  The film was originally released in theaters on January 25, 1961, and was a box office success, pulling the studio out of the financial slump caused by Sleeping Beauty , a costlier production released two years prior, and became the eighth highest-grossing film of the year in the North American box-office. Aside from its box office revenue, its commercial success was due to the employment of inexpensive animation techniques—such as using xerography during the process of inking and painting traditional animation cels—that kept production costs down. Disney would later release a live-action remake titled 101 Dalmatians in 1996 and it's sequel 102 Dalmatians in 2000. A direct to video animated sequel to the 1961 film titled 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure was released in 2003. A live-action reboot titled Cruella directed by Craig Gillespie was released on May 28, 2021 in theaters and on Disney+ with Premier Access simultaneously.\n2296\tOpen Water\t120000\t3.99\t55500000\t[\"Horror\",\"Drama\"]\tBRA48324\t2003\t2003-01-01 00:00:00\t1788\t[\"Blanchard Ryan\",\"Daniel Travis\",\"Saul Stein\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Laura Lau\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Chris Kentis\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Chris Kentis\"]}]\t[\"Lionsgate\"]\tshark\t\t\t79\tOpen Water is a 2003 American survival horror thriller film. The story concerns an American couple who go scuba diving while on vacation, only to find themselves stranded miles from shore in shark-filled waters when the crew of their boat accidentally leaves them behind.  The film is loosely based on the true story of Tom and Eileen Lonergan, who in 1998 went out with a scuba diving group, Outer Edge Dive Company, on the Great Barrier Reef, and were accidentally left behind because the dive-boat crew failed to take an accurate headcount.  The film was financed by the husband and wife team of writer/director Chris Kentis and producer Laura Lau, both avid scuba divers. It cost $120,000 to make and was bought by Lions Gate Entertainment for $2.5 million after its screening at the Sundance Film Festival. Lions Gate spent a further $8 million on distribution and marketing. The film ultimately grossed $55.5 million worldwide (including $30 million from the North American box office alone).  Before filming began, the Lonergans' experience was re-created for an episode of ABC's 20/20 , and the segment was repeated after the release of Open Water. Clips from the film were also featured on NBC in \"Troubled Waters\", a Dateline episode (July 7, 2008) with Matt Lauer interviewing two professional divers, Richard Neely and Ally Dalton, who were left adrift at the Great Barrier Reef by a dive boat on May 21, 2008.\n2303\tOrion's Belt\t15000000\t3.99\t14100000\t[\"Thriller\"]\tNCQ4472\t1985\t1985-01-01 00:00:00\t7\t[\"Helge Jordal\",\"Sverre Anker Ousdal\",\"Hans Ola Sørlie\",\"Kjersti Holmen\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Dag Alveberg\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Ola Solum\",\"Tristan DeVere Cole\"]}]\t\tCold War\t[\"Amanda Award for Best Film\",\"Silver nugget for the best Norwegian film\"]\t\t103\tOrion's Belt (Norwegian: Orions belte ) is a 1985 Norwegian dual- language, political action thriller film, directed by Ola Solum and Tristan de Vere Cole.

The film follows three Svalbard-based shabby seamen, played by Helge Jordal, Sverre Anker Ousdal and Hans Ola Sørlie, who discover a Soviet bearing station. They are subsequently targets of Soviet liquidation and American interrogation in an attempt to quiet them and retain the political status quo. The Cold War topics were a critique of the Norwegian policy of allowing a Soviet presence on Svalbard.  The film was produced by Dag Alveberg and Petter Borgli, and the script was written by Briton Richard Harris. Two versions of the film were recorded, a Norwegian cinematic film and an English-language television film. First Solum shot the Norwegian-language scenes, and then Cole shot the same scene with the actors speaking English. The entire crew and cast lived on board a ship which traveled through Svalbard and Finnmark during production.

It follows Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, Hector Barbossa, and the crew of the Black Pearl as they seek to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker. They then prepare to fight the East India Trading Company, led by Cutler Beckett, who controls Davy Jones and plans to extinguish piracy forever.  Two sequels to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl were conceived in 2004, with Elliott and Rossio developing a story arc that would span both films. The film was shot in two shoots during 2005 and 2006, the former of which was released as Dead Man's Chest. This also marks the final film of the series to be directed by Verbinski. With a production budget of nearly US$ 300 million, it was, at time of production, the most expensive film ever made.  Walt Disney Pictures released the film in the United States on May 25, 2007. Critical reviews were mixed; the film was praised for its performances, direction, musical score, action scenes, humor and special effects, but was criticized for its plot, character development and long running time of 168 minutes. Despite this, At World's End was the highest-grossing film of 2007, bringing in over $960 million. It was nominated at the 80th Academy Awards for the Academy Award for Best Makeup and the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, which it lost to La Vie en rose and The Golden Compass , respectively.

The film's story centers on down-on-her-luck Hollywood hooker Vivian Ward, who is hired by Edward Lewis, a wealthy businessman, to be his escort for several business and social functions, and their developing relationship over the course of her week-long stay with him. The film's title Pretty Woman is based on \"Oh, Pretty Woman\", written and sung by Roy Orbison. It is the first film on-screen collaboration between Gere and Roberts; their second film, Runaway Bride , was released in 1999.  Originally intended to be a dark cautionary tale about class and prostitution in Los Angeles, the film was re-conceived as a romantic comedy with a large budget. It was widely successful at the box office and was the third-highest- grossing film of 1990. The film saw the highest number of ticket sales in the US ever for a romantic comedy, with Box Office Mojo listing it as the number- one romantic comedy by the highest estimated domestic tickets sold at 42,176,400, slightly ahead of My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) at 41,419,500 tickets. The film received mixed reviews, though Roberts received a Golden Globe Award and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. In addition, screenwriter J. F.

Some 22 years later in 2007, Aboriginal activist, and convicted Palm Island rioter Lex Wotton presented a screening of the film to the Film Fanatics Society at Petersham Bowling Club.

Starring John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, it tells several stories of criminal Los Angeles. The title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.  Tarantino wrote Pulp Fiction in 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote for True Romance (1993). Its plot occurs out of chronological order. The film is also self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of \"pulp\". Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character's perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an ironic combination of humor and strong violence. TriStar Pictures reportedly turned down the script as \"too demented\". Then Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax fully financed.  Pulp Fiction won the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival, and was a major critical and commercial success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 67th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won Best Original Screenplay; it earned Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman Academy Award nominations and boosted their careers. Its development, marketing, distribution, and profitability had a sweeping effect on independent cinema.  Pulp Fiction is widely regarded as Tarantino's masterpiece, with particular praise for its screenwriting. The self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a touchstone of postmodern film. It is often considered a cultural watershed, influencing films and other media that adopted elements of its style. The cast was also widely praised, with Travolta, Thurman and Jackson earning particular acclaim. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named it the best film since 1983 and it has appeared on many critics' lists of the greatest films ever made. In 2013, Pulp Fiction was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n2452\tPushkin is Our Everything\t\t3.99\t\t[\"Documentary\"]\tKZS53805\t2014\t2014-06-06 00:00:00\t1\t\t[]\t\t\t\t\t71\tPushkin Is Our Everything (Russian: «Пушкин — наше всё») is a 2014 American documentary film directed, written, and produced by Michael Beckelhimer.

It tells the story of Hal Hefner, a fifteen-year-old stutterer who decides to join his school's debate team when he develops a crush on its star member, and addresses the themes of coming of age, sexuality, and finding one's voice.  Blitz conceived a rough storyline for the film while making Spellbound , a documentary about 1999's Scripps National Spelling Bee, but an HBO Films executive persuaded him to write the film based on his own adolescence when he told her about his experiences as a stutterer. The film's producers visited several cities in the United States and Canada; Thompson was cast based on a tape which his agent had sent and a follow-up audition after the first actor cast in the lead was forced to pull out. The film was shot over 30 days in Baltimore, Maryland and Trenton, New Jersey.  Rocket Science premiered on January 19, 2007 at the Sundance Film Festival and was theatrically released on August 10. It was not a financial success, earning only US$756,000 from its $4.5 million budget, though it was well- received by critics. Reviewers praised Thompson and Kendrick's performances and the film's parallels to real life; others believed that the film was deliberately quirky and forgettable. It was nominated for Sundance's Dramatic Grand Jury Prize and three Independent Spirit Awards. Though it failed to win any of the Grand Jury Prizes at Sundance, Blitz won its Dramatic Directing Award.\n2558\tRogue One\t200000000\t4.99\t1056057273\t[\"Musical\",\"Fantasy\",\"Action\",\"Sci-Fi\",\"War\"]\tBEY92341\t2016\t2016-12-10 00:00:00\t2488\t[\"Felicity Jones\",\"Diego Luna\",\"Riz Ahmed\",\"Ben Mendelsohn\",\"Donnie Yen\",\"Jiang Wen\",\"Forest Whitaker\",\"Mads Mikkelsen\",\"Alan Tudyk\",\"Jonathan Aris\",\"Genevieve O'Reilly\",\"Jimmy Smits\",\"Alistair Petrie\",\"Ben Daniels\",\"Stephen Stanton\",\"Ian McElhinney\",\"Fares Fares\",\"Valene Kane\",\"Beau Gadsdon\",\"Dolly Gadsdon\",\"Duncan Pow\",\"Jordan Stephens\",\"Babou Ceesay\",\"Aidan Cook\",\"Daniel Mays\",\"Andy de la Tour\",\"Tony Pitts\",\"Martin Gordon\",\"Eric MacLennan\",\"Robin Pearce\",\"Francis Magee\",\"Bronson Webb\",\"Sharon Duncan-Brewster\",\"Geraldine James\",\"Ariyon Bakare\",\"Simon Farnaby\",\"Drewe Henley\",\"Angus MacInnes\",\"Gabby Wong\",\"Richard Glover\",\"Toby Hefferman\",\"Richard Cunningham\",\"Jack Roth\",\"Michael Gould\",\"Rufus Wright\",\"Michael Shaeffer\",\"Geoff Bell\",\"James Harkness\",\"Derek Arnold\",\"Matt Rippy\",\"Nick Kellington\",\"Michael Nardone\",\"Nathan Plant\",\"Christopher Patrick Nolan\",\"Warwick Davis\",\"Dee Tails\",\"Ruth Bell\",\"May Bell\",\"Angus Wright\",\"Alan Rushton\",\"Robert Benedetti-Hall\",\"Richard Franklin\",\"Weston Gavin\",\"Nick Hobbs\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Kathleen Kennedy\",\"Allison Shearmur\",\"Simon Emanuel\"]},{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"John Knoll\",\"Jason McGatlin\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Gareth Edwards\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Tony Gilroy\",\"Chris Weitz\",\"Gary Whitta\",\"John Knoll\"]}]\t[\"Lucasfilm\"]\t\t[\"Empire Award for Best Film\",\"Empire Award for Best Actress\",\"Empire Award for Best Director\",\"Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film\",\"Saturn Award for Best Director\",\"Saturn Award for Best Special Effects\"]\t[\"Academy Award for Best Visual Effects\",\"Academy Award for Best Sound\",\"BAFTA Award for Best Makeup and Hair\",\"BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects\",\"Empire Award for Best Film\",\"Empire Award for Best Actress\",\"Empire Award for Best Male Newcomer\"]\t133\tRogue One: A Star Wars Story (or simply Rogue One ) is a 2016 American epic space opera film directed by Gareth Edwards. The screenplay by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy is from a story by John Knoll and Gary Whitta. It was produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the first installment of the Star Wars anthology series and an immediate prequel to Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope (1977). The main cast consists of Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk, Riz Ahmed, Jiang Wen, and Forest Whitaker. Set a week before A New Hope , the plot follows a group of rebels who band together to steal plans of the Death Star, the ultimate weapon of the Galactic Empire. The film also details the Rebel Alliance's first effective victory against the Empire, first referenced in A New Hope 's opening crawl.  Based on an idea first pitched by Knoll ten years before it entered development, the film was made to be different in tone and style from the traditional Star Wars films, omitting the customary opening crawl and transitional screen wipes. Principal photography on the film began at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire, in early August 2015 and wrapped in February 2016. The film then went through extensive reshoots directed by Gilroy in mid-2016. With an estimated production budget of at least $220 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.  The film premiered in Los Angeles on December 10, 2016, and was released in the United States on December 16. It received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its acting, story, visuals, musical score, and dark tone, but criticism for its pacing, characters, and digital recreations of Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher. It grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it the 20th- highest-grossing film of all time and the second-highest-grossing film of 2016 during its theatrical run.

Tom Holland stars as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Michael Keaton, Jon Favreau, Gwyneth Paltrow, Zendaya, Donald Glover, Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori, Bokeem Woodbine, Tyne Daly, Marisa Tomei, and Robert Downey Jr. In Spider-Man: Homecoming , Peter Parker tries to balance high school life with being Spider-Man while facing the Vulture.  In February 2015, Marvel Studios and Sony reached a deal to share the character rights of Spider-Man, integrating the character into the established MCU. The following June, Holland was cast as the title character and Watts was hired to direct. This was followed shortly by the hiring of Daley and Goldstein. In April 2016, the film's title was revealed, along with additional cast, including Downey in his MCU role of Tony Stark / Iron Man. Principal photography began in June 2016 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, and continued in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York City. The other screenwriters were revealed during filming, which concluded in Berlin in October 2016. The production team made efforts to differentiate the film from previous Spider-Man films.

Homecoming grossed over $880 million worldwide, becoming the second-most- successful Spider-Man film and the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2017.

It is the fourth feature installment in the Star Trek franchise, and is a sequel to Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984); it completes the story arc begun in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) and continued in The Search for Spock. Intent on returning home to Earth to face trial for their actions in the previous film, the former crew of the USS Enterprise finds the planet in grave danger from an alien probe attempting to contact now- extinct humpback whales. The crew travel to Earth's past to find whales who can answer the probe's call.  After directing The Search for Spock , Nimoy was asked to direct the next feature, and given greater freedom regarding the film's content. Nimoy and producer Harve Bennett conceived a story with an environmental message and no clear-cut villain. Dissatisfied with the first screenplay produced by Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes, Paramount hired The Wrath of Khan writer and director Nicholas Meyer. Meyer and Bennett divided the story between them and wrote different parts of the script, requiring approval from Nimoy, lead actor William Shatner, and executives at Paramount Pictures. Principal photography commenced on February 24, 1986. Unlike previous Star Trek films, The Voyage Home was shot extensively on location; many real settings and buildings were used as stand-ins for scenes set around and in the city of San Francisco. Special effects firm Industrial Light & Magic assisted in post-production and the film's special effects. Few of the humpback whales in the film were real: ILM devised full-size animatronics and small motorized models to stand in for the real creatures. The film was dedicated to the crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger , which broke up 73 seconds after takeoff on the morning of January 28, 1986.  The Voyage Home was released on November 26, 1986, in North America by Paramount Pictures, and became the top-grossing film at the weekend box office. The film's humor and unconventional story were well received by critics, fans of the series, and the general audience. It was financially successful, earning $133 million worldwide, and earned several awards and four Oscar nominations for cinematography and sound.\n2838\tStar Wars Uncut\t\t4.99\t\t[\"Sci-Fi\",\"Musical\",\"Action\",\"Fantasy\"]\tSYO18689\t2010\t2010-01-01 00:00:00\t7\t\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Jamie Wilkinson\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t124\tStar Wars Uncut is a 2010 online parody film produced, edited and directed by Casey Pugh.

It stars Philip Seymour Hoffman as an ailing theater director who works on an increasingly elaborate stage production and whose extreme commitment to realism begins to blur the boundaries between fiction and reality. The film's title is a play on Schenectady, New York, where much of the film is set, and the concept of synecdoche, wherein a part of something represents the whole or vice versa.  The film premiered in competition at the 61st Annual Cannes Film Festival on May 23, 2008. Sony Pictures Classics acquired the United States distribution rights, paying no money but agreeing to give the film's backers a portion of the revenues. It had a limited theatrical release in the U.S. on October 24, 2008, and was a commercial failure on its initial release.  The story and themes of Synecdoche, New York polarized critics: some called it pretentious or self-indulgent, but others declared it a masterpiece and later listed it among the greatest films of all time, with Roger Ebert ranking it as the decade's best. The film was also nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival.\n2947\tTake Down\t2500000\t2.99\t2000000\t[\"Comedy\"]\tKRS38300\t1979\t1979-01-01 00:00:00\t25\t[\"Edward Herrmann\",\"Lorenzo Lamas\",\"Maureen McCormick\",\"Kathleen Lloyd\",\"Maxx Payne\",\"Stephen Furst\",\"Kevin Hooks\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Kieth Merrill\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Kieth Merrill\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t107\tTake Down is a 1979 American comedy-drama sports film directed by Kieth Merrill and released by Buena Vista Distribution Company.

Loosely based on the German fairy tale \"Rapunzel\" in the collection of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm, it is the 50th Disney animated feature film. Featuring the voices of Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi and Donna Murphy, the film tells the story of Rapunzel, a lost, young princess with magical long blonde hair who yearns to leave her secluded tower. Against her foster mother's wishes, she accepts the aid of an intruder to take her out into the world which she has never seen.  Before the film's release, its title was changed from Rapunzel to Tangled , reportedly to market the film gender-neutrally. Tangled spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $260 million, which, if accurate, would make it the most expensive animated film ever made and one of the most expensive films of all time. The film employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional animation while using non-photorealistic rendering to create the impression of a painting. Composer Alan Menken, who had worked on prior Disney animated features, returned to score Tangled.  Tangled premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on November 14, 2010, and went into general release on November 24. The film earned $592 million in worldwide box office revenue, $200 million of which was earned in the United States and Canada, making it the eighth highest-grossing film of 2010, and was praised by critics and audiences for its animation, writing, characters, and musical score. The film was nominated for a number of awards, including Best Original Song at the 83rd Academy Awards. The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 29, 2011; a short film, Tangled Ever After , was released later in 2012 and a television series premiered in 2017.\n2968\tTeddy Bears' Picnic\t800000\t4.99\t2000000\t[\"Comedy\"]\tDLQ17486\t2002\t2002-01-01 00:00:00\t34\t[\"John Michael Higgins\",\"Ming-Na Wen\",\"Henry Gibson\",\"David Rasche\",\"Morgan Fairchild\",\"Brenda Strong\",\"Michael McKean\",\"Alan Thicke\",\"Harry Shearer\",\"Justin Kirk\",\"Travis Wester\",\"George Wendt\",\"Howard Hesseman\",\"Fred Willard\",\"Kurtwood Smith\",\"Larry Miller\",\"Joyce Hyser\",\"Annabelle Gurwitch\"]\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Harry Shearer\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Harry Shearer\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t80\tTeddy Bears' Picnic is a 2002 American comedy film written and directed by Harry Shearer.

It is the sequel to the film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990). The film is distributed in the United States by New Line Cinema, and internationally distributed by 20th Century Fox.  The film follows the adventures of the four Turtles: Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, Raphael, and their Master Splinter. Resuming from the events of the last film, the villain, The Shredder, returns to take back command of the Foot Clan, and work towards getting revenge on the Turtles. When he learns the secret behind the Turtles' mutation, he becomes more dangerous than ever. The film sheds some light on the origins of Splinter and the Turtles, as well as introduces two new villains: Tokka and Rahzar.  Unlike the first film, this entry rarely showed the use of the Turtles' weapons. They instead fight bare-fisted for much of the film, as part of an attempt to tone down the violence of the previous installment. The film was released on March 22, 1991, and received mixed reviews from critics who felt it departed from the much darker tone of the original 1990 film. The film was financially successful, and became the 13th highest-grossing film domestically in the year of its release. The film is dedicated to Muppets creator Jim Henson, who died less than a year before this film's release.

The film was produced by Participant Media and Blueprint Pictures on a budget of $10 million.  Producers Graham Broadbent and Peter Czernin first saw the potential for a film in Deborah Moggach's novel with the idea of exploring the lives of the elderly beyond what one would expect of their age group. With the assistance of screenwriter Ol Parker, they came up with a script in which they take the older characters completely out of their element and involve them in a romantic comedy.  Principal photography began on 10 October 2010 in India, and most of the filming took place in the Indian state of Rajasthan, including the cities of Jaipur and Udaipur. Ravla Khempur, an equestrian hotel which was originally the palace of a tribal chieftain in the village of Khempur, was chosen as the site for the film hotel.  The film was released in the United Kingdom on 24 February 2012 and received positive reception from critics; The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel opened to strong box-office earnings in the United Kingdom, and topped the box office after its second weekend on release. It became a surprise box-office hit following its international release, eventually grossing nearly $137 million worldwide.

It was released in the United States and Canada on August 7, 1987, by Cineplex Odeon Films, and is based on Lewis Carroll's Alice stories. The fourth feature film made at Toronto's Nelvana studio, it was directed by staff member Raymond Jafelice and produced by the firm's founders (Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert and Clive A. Smith). It starred the voices of Keith Knight, Bob Dermer, Jim Henshaw, Tracey Moore and Elizabeth Hanna. In the film, the Care Bears must rescue the Princess of Wonderland from the Evil Wizard and his assistants, Dim and Dumb. After the White Rabbit shows them her photo, the Bears and Cousins search around the Earth for her before enlisting an unlikely replacement, an ordinary girl named Alice, to save her true look- alike. Venturing into Wonderland, the group encounters a host of strange characters, among them a rapping Cheshire Cat and the Jabberwocky.  Adventure in Wonderland was produced and self-financed by Nelvana, after a consortium of American companies helped them with the first two films. Animation was handled by Nelvana and Taiwan's Wang Film Productions. The film featured a musical score by Patricia Cullen along with songs by pop musicians John Sebastian and Natalie Cole. Upon its North American release, the film opened weakly to mixed reviews, and ended up with a $2.6 million gross; worldwide, it barely made back its $5 million cost. In the years since it opened, the film has received VHS release globally and a DVD release in various countries outside North America, which such release is refused by American Distributors due to various complications involving the negative response of its first sequel, leaving this movie abandoned in the US ever since.\n3112\tThe Caterpillar Wish\t1400000\t1.99\t456018\t[\"Family\"]\tHET18629\t2006\t2006-01-01 00:00:00\t2\t[\"Victoria Thaine\",\"Susie Porter\",\"Philip Quast\"]\t[{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Sandra Sciberras\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t100\tThe Caterpillar Wish (also known as Caterpillar Wish ) is a 2006 Australian coming-of-age film, directed by Sandra Sciberras and produced by Kate Whitbread.

S. Lewis's epic fantasy series, The Chronicles of Narnia. It is the second in The Chronicles of Narnia film series from Walden Media, following The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005).  William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, Georgie Henley, Liam Neeson, and Tilda Swinton reprise their roles from the first film, while new cast includes Ben Barnes, Sergio Castellitto, Peter Dinklage, Eddie Izzard, Warwick Davis, Ken Stott, and Vincent Grass. In the film, the four Pevensie children return to Narnia to aid Prince Caspian in his struggle with the \"secret\" help of Aslan for the throne against his corrupt uncle, King Miraz.  Prince Caspian , a British-American production, is the last Narnia film to be co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures, as Disney's 20th Century Fox became the distributor for the next film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader due to budgetary disputes between Disney and Walden Media, but as a result of Disney eventually purchasing Fox on March 20, 2019, Disney now owns the rights to all three Narnia movies. Work on the script began before The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was released, so filming could begin before the actors grew too old for their parts.  Director Andrew Adamson wanted to make the film more spectacular than the first, and created an action sequence not in the novel. The Narnians were designed to look wilder as they have been hiding from persecution, stressing the darker tone of the sequel. The filmmakers also took a Spanish influence for the antagonistic race of the Telmarines. Filming began in February 2007 in New Zealand, but unlike the previous film, the majority of shooting took place in Central Europe, because of the larger sets available in those countries. To keep costs down, Adamson chose to base post-production in the UK, because of recent tax credits there.  The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian premiered on May 7, 2008 at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, before it was theatrically released on May 16 in the United States and on June 26 in the United Kingdom. The film received mostly positive reviews from film critics. Many praised the performances and visual effects; however, the film's darker tone and mature themes drew polarizing opinions. It was a moderate success at the box office, grossing $55 million during its opening weekend. By the end of its theatrical run, it had grossed over $419.7 million worldwide. The film became the 10th- highest-grossing film worldwide in 2008.\n3126\tThe Color Purple\t15000000\t0\t142000000\t[\"Drama\"]\tEBO43438\t1985\t1985-12-16 00:00:00\t2019\t[\"Danny Glover\",\"Whoopi Goldberg\",\"Margaret Avery\",\"Oprah Winfrey\",\"Adolph Caesar\",\"Rae Dawn Chong\",\"Akosua Busia\",\"Laurence Fishburne\",\"Carl Anderson\",\"Leon Rippy\",\"Susan Beaubian\",\"Willard E.

It was Spielberg's eighth film as a director, and marked a turning point in his career as it was a departure from the summer blockbusters for which he had become known. It was also the first feature film directed by Spielberg for which John Williams did not compose the music, instead featuring a score by Quincy Jones, who also produced. The cast stars Whoopi Goldberg in her breakthrough role, with Danny Glover, Oprah Winfrey, Margaret Avery, Rae Dawn Chong, Willard Pugh, and Adolph Caesar.  Filmed in Anson and Union counties in North Carolina, the film tells the story of a young African-American girl named Celie Harris and shows the problems African-American women faced during the early 20th century, including domestic violence, incest, pedophilia, poverty, racism, and sexism. Celie is transformed as she finds her self-worth through the help of two strong female companions.  The film was a box office success, grossing $142 million against a budget of $15 million. The film received acclaim from critics, with particular praise going to its acting (especially Goldberg's performance), direction, screenplay, musical score, and production values; however, it was also criticized by some critics for being \"over-sentimental\" and \"stereotypical\". The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actress for Goldberg, Best Supporting Actress for both Avery and Winfrey, and Best Adapted Screenplay, but did not achieve a single win, though Spielberg did not receive Best Director, holding the record for the film being the most nominations without nominated for his direction and without a win at the Academy Awards since The Turning Point (1977) at this point. It also received four Golden Globe Award nominations, with Whoopi Goldberg winning Best Actress in a Drama. Steven Spielberg received a Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement, and a Golden Globe nomination.

Goyer. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, it is the final installment in Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy , and the sequel to The Dark Knight (2008). Christian Bale stars as Bruce Wayne / Batman, alongside Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Anne Hathaway, Tom Hardy, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Morgan Freeman. Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight , the revolutionary Bane forces Bruce Wayne to resume his role as Batman and save Gotham City from nuclear destruction.  Christopher Nolan was hesitant about returning to the series for a third film, but agreed after developing a story with his brother and Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note. Nolan drew inspiration from Bane's comic book debut in the 1993 \"Knightfall\" storyline, the 1986 series The Dark Knight Returns , and the 1999 storyline \"No Man's Land\". Filming took place from May to November 2011 in locations including Jodhpur, London, Nottingham, Glasgow, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, and Pittsburgh. Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras for much of the filming, including the first six minutes of the film, to optimize the quality of the picture. A vehicle variation of the Batplane and Batcopter termed the \"Bat\", an underground prison set, and a new Batcave set were created specifically for the film. As with The Dark Knight , viral marketing campaigns began early during production. When filming concluded, Warner Bros. refocused its campaign, developing promotional websites, releasing the first six minutes of the film, screening theatrical trailers, and sending out information regarding the film's plot.  The Dark Knight Rises premiered in New York City on July 16, 2012. The film was released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 20, 2012. The film received positive reviews, with praise being directed toward the performances, action sequences, screenplay, direction, musical score, and emotional depth, with many critics deeming it a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. The consensus at Rotten Tomatoes calls it \"ambitious, thoughtful, and potent\". The film grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it the second film in the Batman film series to earn $1 billion. In addition to being Nolan's highest-grossing film, it became the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release, as well as the third-highest-grossing film of 2012.\n3163\tThe Daytrippers\t\t1.99\t2084559\t[\"Drama\",\"Comedy\"]\tVFJ39159\t1996\t1996-01-01 00:00:00\t101\t[\"Hope Davis\",\"Parker Posey\",\"Liev Schreiber\",\"Anne Meara\",\"Stanley Tucci\",\"Campbell Scott\",\"Stephanie Venditto\",\"Marcia Gay Harden\",\"Douglas McGrath\",\"Adam Davidson\",\"Peter Askin\",\"Paul Herman\",\"Amy Stiller\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Steven Soderbergh\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Greg Mottola\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Greg Mottola\"]}]\t\t\t[\"Grand prix\"]\t\t84\tThe Daytrippers is a 1996 independent comedy-drama film written and directed by Greg Mottola.

The film stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. It is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy. The story, spanning from 1945 to 1955, chronicles the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of his youngest son, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.  Paramount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel for the price of $80,000, before it gained popularity. Studio executives had trouble finding a director; the first few candidates turned down the position before Coppola signed on to direct the film but disagreement followed over casting several characters, in particular, Vito and Michael. Filming took place primarily on location around New York City and in Sicily, and was completed ahead of schedule. The musical score was composed principally by Nino Rota, with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola.  The Godfather premiered at the Loew's State Theatre on March 14, 1972, and was widely released in the United States on March 24, 1972. It was the highest-grossing film of 1972, and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever made, earning between $246 and $287 million at the box office. The film received universal acclaim from critics and audiences, with praise for the performances, particularly those of Brando and Pacino, the directing, screenplay, cinematography, editing, score, and portrayal of the mafia. The Godfather acted as a catalyst for the successful careers of Coppola, Pacino, and other relative newcomers in the cast and crew. Additionally the film revitalized Brando's career, which had declined in the 1960s, and he went on to star in films such as Last Tango in Paris , Superman , and Apocalypse Now.  At the 45th Academy Awards, the film won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). In addition, the seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, Caan, and Duvall for Best Supporting Actor, and Coppola for Best Director. Since its release, The Godfather has been widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, especially in the gangster genre. It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1990, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and is ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane ) by the American Film Institute. It was followed by sequels The Godfather Part II (1974) and The Godfather Part III (1990).\n3251\tThe Graduates\t\t3.99\t\t[\"Comedy\",\"Drama\",\"Family\"]\tAYO75571\t2008\t2008-01-01 00:00:00\t9\t\t[]\t\t\t\t\t94\tThe Graduates is a 2008 American coming-of-age teen comedy film directed and written by Ryan Gielen.

The film follows the Carters, a suburban family targeted by a family of cannibal savages after becoming stranded in the Nevada desert.  Following Craven's directorial debut, The Last House on the Left (1972), producer Peter Locke was interested in financing a similar project. Craven based the film's script on the legend of Scottish cannibal Sawney Bean, which Craven viewed as illustrating how supposedly civilized people could become savage. Other influences on the film include John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath (1940) and Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). The Hills Have Eyes was shot in the Mojave Desert. The film's crew were initially unenthusiastic about the project, but this changed as they came to believe that they were making a special movie.  The Hills Have Eyes earned $25 million at the box office and spawned a franchise. All subsequent films in the series were made with Craven's involvement. The Hills Have Eyes was released on VHS in 1988 and has subsequently been released on DVD and Blu-ray, while Don Peake's score for the film has been released on CD and vinyl. Reviews for the film were mostly positive, with critics praising its tense narrative and humor. Some critics have interpreted the film as containing commentary on morality and American politics, and the film has since become a cult classic.\n3293\tThe Hole in the Ground\t\t0\t3400000\t[\"Horror\",\"Thriller\"]\tIGT36767\t2019\t2019-01-01 00:00:00\t548\t[\"Seána Kerslake\",\"Simone Kirby\",\"James Cosmo\",\"Steve Wall\",\"Eoin Macken\",\"Kati Outinen\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Conor Barry\",\"John Keville\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Lee Cronin\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Lee Cronin\",\"Stephen Shields\"]}]\t[\"Screen Ireland\",\"Wallimage\",\"VOO\",\"BeTV\",\"BNP Paribas\",\"Broadcasting Authority of Ireland\",\"Finnish Film Foundation\"]\t\t\t\t90\tThe Hole in the Ground is a 2019 supernatural horror film directed by Lee Cronin in his feature debut film, from a screenplay by Cronin and Stephen Shields.

The 28th Disney animated feature film, it is based on the 1837 Danish fairy tale of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen. The film tells the story of a mermaid princess named Ariel, who dreams of becoming human and falls in love with a human prince named Eric, which leads her to make a magic deal with the sea witch, Ursula, to become human and be with him. Written and directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, with music by Alan Menken and lyrics by Howard Ashman (who also served as producer alongside John Musker), and art direction by Michael Peraza Jr. and Donald A. Towns, the film features the voices of Jodi Benson, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Pat Carroll, Samuel E. Wright, Jason Marin, Kenneth Mars, Buddy Hackett, and René Auberjonois.  Walt Disney planned to put the story in a proposed package film containing Andersen's stories, but scrapped the project. In 1985, while working on The Great Mouse Detective (1986), Clements and Musker decided to adapt the fairy tale and proposed it to Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, who initially declined due to its similarities to a proposed sequel to the 1984 film Splash , but ultimately approved of it. Ashman became involved and brought in Menken. With supervision from Katzenberg, they made a Broadway- style structure with musical numbers as the staff was working on Oliver & Company (1988). Katzenberg warned that the film would earn less since it appealed to females, but he eventually became convinced that it would be Disney's first blockbuster hit.  The Little Mermaid was released to theaters on November 17, 1989 to critical acclaim, earning praise for the animation, music, and characters. It was also a commercial success, garnering $84 million at the domestic box office during its initial release, and $233 million in total lifetime gross worldwide. After the major success of both the 1986 Disney animated film The Great Mouse Detective and the 1988 Disney/Amblin live-action/animated film Who Framed Roger Rabbit , The Little Mermaid is given credit for breathing life back into the art of Disney animated feature films after some films produced by Disney were struggling. It also marked the start of the era known as the Disney Renaissance. The film won two Academy Awards for Best Original Score and Best Original Song (\"Under the Sea\").

R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The film is the first instalment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It was produced by Barrie M. Osborne, Jackson, Fran Walsh and Tim Sanders, and written by Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Jackson. The film features an ensemble cast including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Sean Bean, Ian Holm, and Andy Serkis. It was followed in 2002 by The Two Towers and in 2003 by The Return of the King.  Set in Middle-earth, the story tells of the Dark Lord Sauron, who seeks the One Ring, which contains part of his soul, in order to return to power. The Ring has found its way to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins. The fate of Middle- earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions (who form the Fellowship of the Ring) begin their journey to Mount Doom in the land of Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed.  The Fellowship of the Ring was financed and distributed by American studio New Line Cinema, but filmed and edited entirely in Jackson's native New Zealand, concurrently with the other two parts of the trilogy. It premiered on 10 December 2001 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London and was theatrically released worldwide on 19 December 2001. The film was highly acclaimed by critics and fans alike, who considered it to be a landmark in filmmaking and an achievement in the fantasy film genre. It received high praise for its visual effects, performances, Jackson's direction, screenplay, and faithfulness to the source material. It grossed $860.5 million worldwide in its initial release, making it the second highest-grossing film of 2001 and the fifth highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release. Following subsequent reissues, it has as of 2021 grossed over $897 million.   The Fellowship of the Ring is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made. The film received numerous accolades; at the 74th Academy Awards, it was nominated for thirteen awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor for McKellen, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Original Song for \"May It Be\" and Best Sound, winning four: Best Cinematography, Best Makeup, Best Original Score and Best Visual Effects.\n3389\tThe Love Witch\t\t1.99\t246218\t[\"Thriller\",\"Horror\"]\tDGM72118\t2016\t2016-01-01 00:00:00\t462\t[\"Jeffrey Vincent Parise\",\"Elle Evans\",\"Clive Ashborn\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Anna Biller\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Anna Biller\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Anna Biller\"]}]\t\t\t\t[\"IFFR audience award\"]\t120\tThe Love Witch is a 2016 American comedy horror/tragedy film written, edited, directed, produced, and scored by Anna Biller.

Produced between the first and second half of The Muppet Show 's third season, the film tells the origin story of the Muppets, as Kermit the Frog embarks on a cross-country trip to Hollywood, encountering several of the Muppets—who all share the same ambition of finding success in professional show business—along the way while being pursued by Doc Hopper, an evil restaurateur with intentions of employing Kermit as a spokesperson for his frog legs business.  In addition to the Muppets performers, the film stars Charles Durning and Austin Pendleton, and it features cameo appearances by Dom DeLuise, James Coburn, Edgar Bergen (in his final film appearance), Steve Martin, and Mel Brooks, among others. Notable for its surreal humour, meta-references and prolific use of cameos, The Muppet Movie was released in the United Kingdom on May 31, 1979, and in the United States on June 22, 1979, and it received critical praise, including two Academy Award nominations for Paul Williams and Kenneth Ascher's musical score and their song, \"Rainbow Connection\". The success of The Muppet Movie led to several other feature films and television series starring the Muppets across different media. In 2009, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.  The Muppet Movie was produced by ITC Films and Henson Associates, distributed by Associated Film Distribution.

The film co- stars Jada Pinkett, James Coburn, Larry Miller, Dave Chappelle and John Ales. The original music score was composed by David Newman. The film won Best Makeup at the 69th Academy Awards.  Murphy portrays a university professor, Sherman Klump, a brainy and kind- hearted man who is morbidly obese. A research scientist, academic, and lecturer, Klump develops a miraculous, but experimental, weight-loss pharmaceutical, and hoping to win the affection of the girl of his dreams, tests it upon himself. Like the original film's Julius Kelp, Klump's vigorous, charismatic, but evil alter ego takes the name \"Buddy Love\". Murphy plays a total of seven characters in the film, including Sherman and most of Sherman's family.  The film received positive reviews, with critics particularly praising the makeup and Murphy's performance.

Logan Lerman stars as a teenager named Charlie who writes to an unnamed friend, and these epistles chronicle his trials, tribulations, and triumphs as he goes through his freshman year of high school. The film depicts his struggles with his, unbeknownst to him, post-traumatic stress disorder, as he goes through his journey in high school making new friends (played by Emma Watson and Ezra Miller). The film's ensemble cast also includes Mae Whitman, Kate Walsh, Dylan McDermott, Joan Cusack, and Paul Rudd in supporting roles.  Chbosky had always intended to adapt the novel to film, but did not rush to do so. He was hesitant to sell the rights to the film to anyone, but eventually sold them to Mr. Mudd Productions as long as they let him write and direct the film. Filming began in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in May 2011 and lasted approximately fifty days. This is one of three films from John Malkovich, Lianne Halfon and Russell Smith's Mr. Mudd Productions that feature struggling teenagers; the other two are Ghost World (2001) and Juno (2007).   The Perks of Being a Wallflower had its world premiere at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2012 to a standing ovation. It was released theatrically in the United States on September 21, 2012, by Summit Entertainment. The film was well received by critics, who praised Chbosky's screenplay and direction, the performances of Lerman, Watson and Miller, soundtrack, execution of its topics, and emotional weight. It was also a box office success, grossing $33.4 million on a budget of $13 million, and received several accolades, including the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature, two Critics' Choice Movie Awards nominations, including Best Adapted Screenplay for Chbosky, and the 2013 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film – Wide Release.\n3469\tThe Ploughman's Lunch\t\t1.99\t\t[\"Drama\"]\tGRK61164\t1983\t1983-01-01 00:00:00\t89\t[\"Jonathan Pryce\",\"Tim Curry\",\"Charlie Dore\",\"Rosemary Harris\",\"Frank Finlay\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Simon Relph\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Richard Eyre\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Ian McEwan\"]}]\t[\"Goldcrest Films\"]\t\t\t\t107\tThe Ploughman's Lunch is a 1983 British drama film written by Ian McEwan and directed by Richard Eyre which features Jonathan Pryce, Tim Curry, and Rosemary Harris.

The first installment in the Toy Story franchise, it was the first entirely computer- animated feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. The film was directed by John Lasseter (in his feature directorial debut), and written by Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen, and Alec Sokolow from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft. The film features music by Randy Newman, was produced by Bonnie Arnold and Ralph Guggenheim, and was executive-produced by Steve Jobs and Edwin Catmull. The film features the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney, Annie Potts, R. Lee Ermey, John Morris, Laurie Metcalf, and Erik von Detten. Taking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll named Woody and an astronaut action figure, Buzz Lightyear, as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner, Andy Davis, to friends who work together to be reunited with Andy after being separated from him.  Following the success of their 1988 short film Tin Toy , Pixar was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \"edgier\". After several disastrous story reels, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and ... this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under only minor financial constraints.  Toy Story premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, California, on November 19, 1995, and was released in theaters in North America on November 22, 1995. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend, eventually grossing over $373 million worldwide, making it the second highest- grossing film of 1995. The film received critical acclaim, and holds a rare 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It was praised for the technical innovation of the 3D animation, wit and thematic sophistication of the screenplay, musical score, and vocal performances (particularly Hanks and Allen); it is considered by many to be one of the best animated films ever made. The film received three Academy Award nominations (Best Original Screenplay (the first animated film to be nominated for this award), Best Original Song for \"You've Got a Friend in Me\", and Best Original Score) as well as winning a Special Achievement Academy Award. In 2005, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The success of Toy Story launched a multimedia franchise and a series of three sequels, starting with Toy Story 2 (1999).\n3709\tTrancers\t\t0.99\t\t[\"Action\",\"Sci-Fi\",\"Family\",\"Fantasy\"]\tQQL93219\t1985\t1985-01-01 00:00:00\t137\t[\"Tim Thomerson\",\"Helen Hunt\",\"Art LaFleur\",\"Richard Herd\",\"Telma Hopkins\",\"Anne Seymour\",\"Biff Manard\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Charles Band\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Charles Band\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Danny Bilson\"]}]\t\ttime travel\t\t\t88\tTrancers (also released as Future Cop ) is a 1984 American science fiction action film directed by Charles Band and starring Tim Thomerson, Helen Hunt, and Art LaFleur.

The Autobots intend to retrieve and use the AllSpark, the powerful artifact that created their robotic race that is on Earth, to rebuild their home planet Cybertron and end the war, while the Decepticons have the intention of using it to build an army by giving life to the machines of Earth. Tyrese Gibson, Josh Duhamel, Anthony Anderson, Megan Fox, Rachael Taylor, John Turturro, and Jon Voight also star, while voice actors Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving voice Optimus Prime and Megatron respectively.  Murphy and DeSanto developed the project in 2003, and DeSanto wrote a treatment. Steven Spielberg came on board the following year, hiring Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman to write the screenplay. The U.S. Armed Forces and General Motors (GM) loaned vehicles and aircraft during filming, which saved money for the production and added realism to the battle scenes. Hasbro's promotional campaign for the film included deals with various companies; advertising included a viral marketing campaign, coordinated releases of prequel comic books, toys, and books, as well as product placement deals with companies such as GM, Burger King, and eBay.  Transformers received mixed reviews from critics and a positive response from audiences. It became the fifth highest-grossing film of 2007, grossing $709 million worldwide, with an estimated 46 million tickets sold in the US. The film won four awards from the Visual Effects Society and was nominated for three Academy Awards, for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects. LaBeouf's performance was praised by Empire , and Cullen's reprisal of Optimus Prime from the 1980s television series was well received by fans. The film was followed by four sequels, Revenge of the Fallen (2009), Dark of the Moon (2011), Age of Extinction (2014), and The Last Knight (2017), as well as a spin-off titled Bumblebee in 2018.\n3723\tTrash Fire\t\t0.99\t\t[\"Horror\"]\tNOS86885\t2016\t2016-01-23 00:00:00\t31\t[\"Adrian Grenier\"]\t[]\t\t\t\t\t93\tTrash Fire is a 2016 American black comedy film written and directed by Richard Bates Jr. and starring Adrian Grenier, Angela Trimbur, Fionnula Flanagan, AnnaLynne McCord, Matthew Gray Gubler, and Sally Kirkland.

It stars an ensemble cast, including Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Elliot Page, Peter Dinklage, Ian McKellen, and Patrick Stewart. The story, inspired by the 1981 Uncanny X-Men storyline \"Days of Future Past\" by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, focuses on two time periods, with Logan traveling back in time to 1973 to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants.  Vaughn had directed X-Men: First Class and was set to return in Days of Future Past before leaving for Kingsman: The Secret Service and the 2015 version of Fantastic Four. Thus Singer, who had directed the first two X- Men films, made his return as a director, and brought along most of the crew from those productions. With a budget of $205 million principal photography began in Montreal, Quebec in April 2013 and concluded in August the same year, with additional filming and pick-ups taking place in November 2013 and February 2014. Twelve companies handled the visual effects.  X-Men: Days of Future Past premiered in New York City on May 10, 2014, and was theatrically released on May 23 by 20th Century Fox. It is the second- best-reviewed film in the X-Men film series following Logan , drawing favorable notices for its story, visual effects, action scenes, score, acting, thematic elements, screenplay, and Singer's direction. During its theatrical run, the film earned over $746 million worldwide, making it the sixth-highest- grossing film of 2014, as well as the third-highest-grossing film in the series behind Deadpool and Deadpool 2. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects, making it the first X-Men film to be nominated for an Oscar.

Northup was put to work on plantations in the state of Louisiana for 12 years before being released. The first scholarly edition of Northup's memoir, co-edited in 1968 by Sue Eakin and Joseph Logsdon, carefully retraced and validated the account and concluded it to be accurate. Other characters in the film were also real people, including Edwin and Mary Epps, and Patsey.  The film was directed by Steve McQueen, and the screenplay was written by John Ridley. Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Solomon Northup. Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Lupita Nyong'o, Sarah Paulson, Brad Pitt, and Alfre Woodard feature in supporting roles. Principal photography took place in New Orleans, Louisiana, from June 27 to August 13, 2012. The locations used were four historic antebellum plantations: Felicity, Bocage, Destrehan, and Magnolia. Of the four, Magnolia is nearest to the actual plantation where Northup was held.  12 Years a Slave received widespread critical praise and was named the best film of 2013 by several media outlets and critics, and it earned over $187 million on a production budget of $22 million. The film received nine Academy Award nominations, winning three: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Nyong'o. The Best Picture win made McQueen the first black British producer to ever receive the award and the first black British director of a Best Picture winner. The film was awarded the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama, and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts recognized it with the Best Film and the Best Actor award for Ejiofor. 12 Years a Slave was later named the 44th greatest film since 2000 in a BBC poll of 177 critics.\n26\t1 Day\t750000\t0.99\t\t[\"Crime\",\"Drama\"]\tWPD85680\t2009\t2009-11-06 00:00:00\t12\t[\"Lady Leshurr\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Penny Woolcock\"]},{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"Allan Niblo\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Penny Woolcock\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Penny Woolcock\"]}]\t\t\t\t\t102\t1 Day is a 2009 British crime film about gangs and their communities in inner city Birmingham.

It employs disturbing, violent images to comment on psychiatry, juvenile delinquency, youth gangs, and other social, political, and economic subjects in a dystopian near-future Britain.  Alex (Malcolm McDowell), the central character, is a charismatic, antisocial delinquent whose interests include classical music (especially Beethoven), committing rape, theft and what is termed \"ultra-violence\". He leads a small gang of thugs, Pete (Michael Tarn), Georgie (James Marcus), and Dim (Warren Clarke), whom he calls his droogs (from the Russian word друг, \"friend\", \"buddy\"). The film chronicles the horrific crime spree of his gang, his capture, and attempted rehabilitation via an experimental psychological conditioning technique (the \"Ludovico Technique\") promoted by the Minister of the Interior (Anthony Sharp). Alex narrates most of the film in Nadsat, a fractured adolescent slang composed of Slavic (especially Russian), English, and Cockney rhyming slang.  The film premiered in New York City on 19 December 1971 and was released in the United Kingdom on 13 January 1972. The film was met with polarised reviews from critics, and was also heavily controversial due to its depictions of graphic violence. It was later withdrawn from British cinemas at Kubrick's behest, and was also banned in several other countries. In the years following, the film underwent a critical re-evaluation and gained a cult following. It received several awards and nominations, including four nominations at the 44th Academy Awards.  In 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n100\tA Fish Called Wanda\t8000000\t4.99\t177900000\t[\"Action\",\"Comedy\"]\tOLC25144\t1988\t1988-07-07 00:00:00\t1107\t[\"Jamie Lee Curtis\",\"Kevin Kline\",\"Michael Palin\",\"John Cleese\",\"Maria Aitken\",\"Patricia Hayes\",\"Stephen Fry\",\"Tom Georgeson\",\"Geoffrey Palmer\",\"Cynthia Cleese\",\"Neville Phillips\",\"Ken Campbell\",\"Roger Hume\",\"Roger Brierley\",\"Llewellyn Rees\",\"Andrew MacLachlan\",\"Roland MacLeod\",\"Jeremy Child\",\"Sharon Twomey\",\"David Simeon\",\"Robert McBain\",\"John Bird\"]\t[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Michael Shamberg\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Charles Crichton\",\"John Cleese\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"John Cleese\",\"Charles Crichton\"]}]\t[\"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\"]\t\t[\"Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor\"]\t[\"Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor\",\"Academy Award for Best Director\",\"Academy Award for Best Writing, Original Screenplay\"]\t108\tA Fish Called Wanda is a 1988 British-American heist comedy film directed by Charles Crichton (in his final film), and written by Crichton, and John Cleese.
